These are mostly for my personal use.  Using some somewhat obscure versions of software, for example the compton-tryone-git from the AUR, otherwise the blur options in compton.conf won't do anything.  

I'm pretty happy with my powerline theme for weechat and ncmpcpp.  Speaking of powerline, the i3 configuartion assumes powerline is installed, same with vim and tmux.  Zsh config relies on oh-my-zsh.
