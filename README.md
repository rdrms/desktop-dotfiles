These are mostly for my personal use.  Using some somewhat obscure versions of software, for example the compton-tryone-git from the AUR (needs to be updated for picom TODO eventually), otherwise the blur options in compton.conf won't do anything.  

I'm pretty happy with my themes for weechat and ncmpcpp.  The i3 configuartion is legacy, I don't use i3 anymore, and the tmux and vim are also not used anymore.  Zsh config relies on oh-my-zsh, along with zsh-autosuggestions and zsh-completions.
