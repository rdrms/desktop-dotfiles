2018-08-30 16:46:18	rydare	hey i probably am not supposed to say this in the channel
2018-08-30 16:46:27	rydare	but you might be better served by Manjaro
2018-08-30 16:46:35	rydare	it's based on Arch so it has the latest drivers and packages
2018-08-30 16:46:57	deicide-	i was told fedora is cutting edge
2018-08-30 16:47:10	rydare	and the installer lets you toggle to the proprietary driver during the install and automatically installs it
2018-08-30 16:47:32	rydare	fedora has fairly new packages, but they're really anal about non-free stuff, you have to add RPMfusion and get the drivers from there
2018-08-30 16:47:54	rydare	i installed it not too long ago and it was fairly simple
2018-08-30 16:48:02	rydare	but for me debian was easy too
2018-08-30 16:48:54	rydare	sorry for PMing you I just didn't want to recommend a different distro in the #debian channel
2018-08-30 16:51:54	deicide-	never saw anyone recommending that os
2018-08-30 16:52:15	rydare	if you go on distrowatch.com it's the top one in terms of traffic
2018-08-30 16:52:32	rydare	those statistics can be manipulated though
2018-08-30 16:52:39	rydare	i really liked manjaro though
2018-08-30 16:52:50	deicide-	its good for gaming?
2018-08-30 16:53:01	rydare	well it has the latest verisons of everything
2018-08-30 16:53:11	rydare	so the absolute newest driver available
2018-08-30 16:53:17	deicide-	are the commands somewhat the same?
2018-08-30 16:53:38	rydare	apt install x -> pacman -S x
2018-08-30 16:53:49	rydare	apt upgrade -> pacman -Syu
2018-08-30 16:54:02	rydare	although if you do go that route, i suggest using yay
2018-08-30 16:54:03	deicide-	somewhat the same ok
2018-08-30 16:54:10	deicide-	i'll look into it
2018-08-30 16:54:21	rydare	i think it would suit you
2018-08-30 16:54:30	rydare	maybe try updating your Debian to testing first
2018-08-30 16:54:33	rydare	see if that's new enough
2018-08-30 16:54:42	deicide-	going back to windows
2018-08-30 16:54:46	<--	deicide- (~deicide-@unaffiliated/deicide-) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2018-08-30 16:54:47	rydare	but if it isn't, manjaro/arch is the absolute cutting edge of Linux
2018-08-30 16:54:47	--	deicide-: No such nick/channel
2018-08-30 16:59:16	deicide-	back
2018-08-30 16:59:30	rydare	pfft i'm not talking to no windows user
2018-08-30 16:59:32	rydare	lolol
2018-08-30 16:59:38	rydare	jk i have a windows drive
2018-08-30 16:59:42	deicide-	manjarp?
2018-08-30 16:59:49	deicide-	manjaro
2018-08-30 16:59:50	rydare	manjaro is the name
2018-08-30 16:59:51	rydare	yeah
2018-08-30 16:59:56	rydare	it comes in various flavours
2018-08-30 17:00:02	rydare	do you know what desktop you like/
2018-08-30 17:00:08	deicide-	xfce
2018-08-30 17:00:13	deicide-	its the most windows like
2018-08-30 17:00:26	rydare	i think that's the first one listed on the downloads link
2018-08-30 17:01:10	rydare	tip: swap out the default Xfce compositor for compton with the opengl backend to stop screen tearing
2018-08-30 17:01:20	deicide-	Today at 02:00
2018-08-30 17:01:20	deicide-	i was told fedora is aids when it comes to non-free
2018-08-30 17:01:24	deicide-	Ordy Holy VirginToday at 02:01
2018-08-30 17:01:24	deicide-	nah fedora is fine
2018-08-30 17:01:24	deicide-	just add repo and there you go
2018-08-30 17:01:42	rydare	yeah you add a repo
2018-08-30 17:01:45	rydare	it's not too hard
2018-08-30 17:01:54	rydare	but it doesn't come out of the box with the nvidia driver like manjaro does
2018-08-30 17:01:57	deicide-	thats somewhat the problem with linux community everyone have different opinion\experience
2018-08-30 17:02:09	rydare	well, everyone likes different things
2018-08-30 17:02:19	rydare	fedora is good because when you update, you only download the change
2018-08-30 17:02:36	rydare	like if a package is 150mb, but only 2mb has changed from the last version, you download 2mb
2018-08-30 17:02:59	deicide-	thats nice
2018-08-30 17:03:07	rydare	manjaro/arch is good because if a package isn't in the repos, it's almost guaranteed to be in the AUR, so you can very easily compile and install it using the package manager
2018-08-30 17:03:27	deicide-	"i don't because i have never tried. I am a nab also. What i can say is what you might easily find googling, being that it's not the stablest and also don't expect arch to be the best place to go when you have to find a solution to a problem
2018-08-30 17:03:27	deicide-	"
2018-08-30 17:03:47	rydare	ubuntu is good because there's usually a PPA you can install from, but I find the AUR is better for weird versions of software
2018-08-30 17:03:48	deicide-	i agree with him arch community doesn't look like good place for noob like me
2018-08-30 17:03:55	rydare	the wiki is really good
2018-08-30 17:04:02	rydare	i use it all the time no matter what distro i'm using
2018-08-30 17:04:10	rydare	never posted on the forums though
2018-08-30 17:04:15	rydare	or been in arch irc
2018-08-30 17:06:23	deicide-	dunno sometimes human input is much better than googling
2018-08-30 17:06:30	deicide-	alot of times*
2018-08-30 17:06:31	deicide-	well
2018-08-30 17:06:34	deicide-	99% of the time
2018-08-30 17:06:35	deicide-	lol
2018-08-30 17:08:10	rydare	haha
2018-08-30 17:08:19	rydare	i don't mind asking if i can't find tha answer googling
2018-08-30 17:08:27	rydare	but i feel dumb when i ask and continue googling and find the answer
2018-08-30 17:08:31	deicide-	so fedora vs manjaro
2018-08-30 17:09:02	rydare	https://www.slant.co/versus/2688/2706/~fedora_vs_manjaro-linux  check this out
2018-08-30 17:09:09	rydare	might be a little out of date
2018-08-30 17:09:27	rydare	https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=manjaro
2018-08-30 17:09:33	rydare	https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=fedora
2018-08-30 17:09:42	rydare	it lists the packages like the kernel and nvidia driver
2018-08-30 17:09:59	rydare	but for some stuff that's not free it doesn't list it for fedora
2018-08-30 17:10:06	rydare	since they don't include it and you have to go to a third party repo
2018-08-30 17:10:24	rydare	green means latest
2018-08-30 17:10:29	rydare	red means beta/allpha
2018-08-30 17:10:34	rydare	black means not latest
2018-08-30 17:11:29	rydare	i'd totally say fedora if you were going to use GNOME
2018-08-30 17:11:33	rydare	it's the best GNOME distro
2018-08-30 17:11:42	deicide-	xfce
2018-08-30 17:11:44	rydare	not that their Xfce version is bad
2018-08-30 17:11:50	rydare	it's just not their main focus
2018-08-30 17:11:52	deicide-	i just want stuff to work
2018-08-30 17:12:10	deicide-	with as little fiddle as possible
2018-08-30 17:12:23	deicide-	as much windows as it can i guess'
2018-08-30 17:15:27	deicide-	manjaro has no irc chan here :O
2018-08-30 17:15:35	deicide-	fedora does
2018-08-30 17:18:05	rydare	#manjaro doesn't work?
2018-08-30 17:18:27	deicide-	oh it doesn't show up in search
2018-08-30 17:18:36	deicide-	1\5 of users
2018-08-30 17:19:03	deicide-	oh man this is so hard to pick between
2018-08-30 17:19:11	deicide-	especially when xfce is main on manjaro
2018-08-30 17:20:02	rydare	Xubuntu is also an option
2018-08-30 17:20:08	rydare	great for beginners
2018-08-30 17:20:16	rydare	because there's so much help available
2018-08-30 17:20:35	rydare	like discord for example, just publishes a .deb for ubuntu and a .tar.gz for everything else
2018-08-30 17:20:44	rydare	but you can usually find a package in your distro
2018-08-30 17:21:19	deicide-	yea couldn't install discord or steam in debian
2018-08-30 17:22:55	rydare	you can get the latest nvidia in ubuntu
2018-08-30 17:23:01	rydare	it's just a case of adding a repo
2018-08-30 17:23:05	deicide-	ubuntu is a no go
2018-08-30 17:23:13	deicide-	might aswell stay on windows
2018-08-30 17:24:41	rydare	hmm
2018-08-30 17:25:01	rydare	ubuntu is fine for me, i just wanted something different
2018-08-30 17:25:08	rydare	so i switched to various distros
2018-08-30 17:25:16	deicide-	telemtry
2018-08-30 17:25:58	rydare	fedora, elementary OS, openSUSE, Arch, Manjaro, Mint, Solus, KDE Neon, FreeBSD
2018-08-30 17:26:22	rydare	like almost half of those are based on Ubuntu
2018-08-30 17:26:26	rydare	and Ubuntu is based on Debian
2018-08-30 17:26:30	rydare	so i figured i'd go to the source
2018-08-30 17:26:39	rydare	and Debian is perfect for me
2018-08-30 17:26:45	rydare	but it's not for everyone
2018-08-30 17:26:54	rydare	especially if you want the latest software and drivers
2018-08-30 17:26:58	rydare	which is why i said manjaro
2018-08-30 17:27:12	rydare	it's like Arch with an easy install
2018-08-30 17:27:23	rydare	and preconfigured desktop environments
2018-08-30 17:27:29	rydare	instead of having to edit the time zone file yourself
2018-08-30 17:27:36	rydare	and install the nvidia drivers
2018-08-30 17:27:47	rydare	it has a little wizard to check what you're running and what hardware you have
2018-08-30 17:27:47	deicide-	debian is perfect on my laptop
2018-08-30 17:27:54	rydare	intel graphics?
2018-08-30 17:28:15	deicide-	aye
2018-08-30 17:28:19	deicide-	thinkpad too
2018-08-30 17:28:25	rydare	nice, what model/
2018-08-30 17:28:26	rydare	?
2018-08-30 17:28:31	deicide-	so it meant to be runing with linux
2018-08-30 17:28:33	deicide-	t470
2018-08-30 17:28:40	rydare	ah ok
2018-08-30 17:28:47	rydare	i'm thinking of getting an x230
2018-08-30 17:29:25	deicide-	14" is my bare minimum
2018-08-30 17:29:57	deicide-	hard to get used to 14" once you've used 27 for years
2018-08-30 17:43:09	deicide-	ok i'm leaning towards manjora
2018-08-30 17:43:26	rydare	newer packages and a rolling release
2018-08-30 17:43:35	rydare	fedora is more stable because the packages dont change
2018-08-30 17:43:35	deicide-	https://www.slant.co/versus/2688/2706/~fedora_vs_manjaro-linux
2018-08-30 17:43:49	rydare	but if you want stable debian stable can't be beat
2018-08-30 17:43:54	deicide-	lol it has like 2x the pros
2018-08-30 17:44:18	rydare	lots of that depend on what you're using it for
2018-08-30 17:44:20	deicide-	what does it mean by stable on linux?
2018-08-30 17:44:26	deicide-	freezes and "bsod"?
2018-08-30 17:44:36	rydare	well most linux distros are stable... they don't crash
2018-08-30 17:44:55	rydare	but debian stable's GIMP for example is stable... it is version 2.8 and wont change except for security fixes
2018-08-30 17:44:58	deicide-	what i use it for? windows replacment
2018-08-30 17:45:15	rydare	Manjaro's GIMP is unstable... today it's 2.8, tomorrow it's 2.10 and has brand new features
2018-08-30 17:45:36	rydare	maybe it's useful, maybe it breaks your workflow
2018-08-30 17:45:45	rydare	which is why debian stable is better for servers
2018-08-30 17:45:54	rydare	and manjaro is not so great for servers since it can break easier
2018-08-30 17:46:03	rydare	since you're constantly changing things
2018-08-30 17:46:07	deicide-	debian is unstable for me sincei have new hardware
2018-08-30 17:46:13	rydare	but on a desktop you usually want the latest software
2018-08-30 17:46:14	deicide-	i already had it freeze on me
2018-08-30 17:47:38	rydare	ah, it's been rock solid for me
2018-08-30 17:47:39	rydare	and i'm on testing
2018-08-30 17:47:46	rydare	but so was manjaro
2018-08-30 17:47:55	rydare	fedora had some hiccups for me, i don't know why
2018-08-30 17:48:01	deicide-	never had anything worng with it with my laptop
2018-08-30 17:48:02	rydare	i think it was this one program
2018-08-30 17:49:33	rydare	mpDris2 exposes mpd to the protocol desktops use for media control, but it's sort of buggy
2018-08-30 17:49:40	rydare	had problems with GNOME after it was installed
2018-08-30 17:49:56	deicide-	hows wine in manjora?
2018-08-30 17:50:12	rydare	you get the latest verison, just like everything else
2018-08-30 17:50:18	deicide-	and steam?, do you run steam under any of them?
2018-08-30 17:50:34	rydare	i have run steam on almost every distro
2018-08-30 17:50:40	rydare	works about the same
2018-08-30 17:50:57	deicide-	btw can i add u to steam?
2018-08-30 17:51:00	rydare	i think you just do pacman -S steam
2018-08-30 17:51:02	rydare	if you want
2018-08-30 17:51:06	rydare	rdr2point0
2018-08-30 17:51:32	deicide-	nice avatar
2018-08-30 17:51:54	deicide-	i wonder why its not working on my debian desktop
2018-08-30 17:52:18	deicide-	"Pro
2018-08-30 17:52:18	deicide-	Steam installed by default"
2018-08-30 17:52:22	deicide-	fuck yeah
2018-08-30 17:55:10	deicide-	downloading it
2018-08-30 17:57:33	deicide-	thank you

2018-08-30 22:28:15	rydare	https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/airvpn-bin/
2018-08-30 22:28:23	rydare	yay -S airvpn-bin
2018-08-30 22:28:59	rydare	you can also get an official arch package
2018-08-30 22:29:04	rydare	and download it
2018-08-30 22:29:12	rydare	see the first comment in that link
2018-08-30 22:29:47	deicide-	sudo pacman -U "/path/to/file/eddie-ui_(version.number)_linux_x64_arch.tar.xz" ?
2018-08-30 22:30:13	rydare	yeah so if it's in Downloads/eddie-ui_9.9_etc
2018-08-30 22:30:35	rydare	sudo pacman -U ~/Downloads/eddiewhatever.tar.gz
2018-08-30 22:31:46	deicide-	i have it in my desktop
2018-08-30 22:32:01	deicide-	is it still -U if i added it through the file?
2018-08-30 22:32:15	rydare	-U is installing from a local package

2018-08-30 22:39:07	deicide-	i open it and nothing happens
2018-08-30 22:39:19	rydare	check and see if it's running in the system tray
2018-08-30 22:39:26	rydare	then open a terminal
2018-08-30 22:39:32	rydare	'ps aux | grep steam'

2018-08-30 22:53:40	rydare	For 32-bit (Multilib must be enabled) applications support on 64-bit machines, install:
2018-08-30 22:53:40	rydare	    lib32-virtualgl - A render/display bridge for 32 bit applications.
2018-08-30 22:53:40	rydare	    lib32-nvidia-utils or lib32-nvidia-340xx-utils or lib32-nvidia-304xx-utils - match the version of the 64 bit package.
2018-08-30 22:53:40	rydare	    lib32-mesa-libgl and make sure that lib32-nvidia-libgl is not installed

2018-08-30 22:54:54	deicide-	i have no idea what exactly restarting do but its legit magic
2018-08-30 22:55:06	rydare	probably just needed to kill the steam pids again
2018-08-30 22:55:09	rydare	but restarting works

2018-08-30 22:58:35	deicide-	i need to get smartphone for steam guard..
2018-08-30 22:58:50	deicide-	i heard there was free version of vmware on linux
2018-08-30 22:59:02	deicide-	vmware gaming something
2018-08-30 22:59:34	deicide-	hey we got steam working, progress !!!
2018-08-30 22:59:44	rydare	yeah and i only led you astray twice
2018-08-30 22:59:57	deicide-	nah its fine
2018-08-30 23:00:41	deicide-	especially when it runs so much better than debian
2018-08-30 23:02:35	deicide-	just in case, how do i auto mount drives again at boot
2018-08-30 23:03:53	deicide-	in the meantime i'm going t o get some food
2018-08-30 23:04:07	rydare	you have to edit the /etc/fstab file
2018-08-31 00:09:55	--	irc: disconnected from server
2018-08-31 00:15:59	deicide-	its manually?
2018-08-31 00:16:28	rydare	i think that's the best way
2018-08-31 00:16:49	deicide-	how do i know what to write?
2018-08-31 00:18:12	rydare	well
2018-08-31 00:18:17	rydare	the first column is the device
2018-08-31 00:18:33	rydare	you can find out which one you want by doing 'sudo fdisk -l'
2018-08-31 00:18:37	rydare	it will list your disks
2018-08-31 00:18:58	rydare	for example, my Storage device is the first hard drive, second partition
2018-08-31 00:19:03	rydare	so it becomes /dev/sda2
2018-08-31 00:20:42	rydare	did you find the drive you want to mount?  is it NTFS?
2018-08-31 00:21:23	deicide-	its 8 drives..
2018-08-31 00:21:34	rydare	do you want to mount them all?
2018-08-31 00:22:05	deicide-	ye
2018-08-31 00:22:09	rydare	you probably shouldn't mount your windows partition
2018-08-31 00:22:19	deicide-	why
2018-08-31 00:22:38	rydare	if it's windows 8 or higher windows doesn't really shut down
2018-08-31 00:22:44	rydare	so you get errors when trying to mount
2018-08-31 00:22:54	deicide-	sadly its 10
2018-08-31 00:23:13	rydare	but did you do 'sudo fdisk -l' 
2018-08-31 00:23:25	deicide-	ye
2018-08-31 00:24:01	rydare	ok, so decide which ones you want to mount, and take note / copy the drive name
2018-08-31 00:24:18	deicide-	i want to have my linux on as much as possible with windows being booted barely never
2018-08-31 00:24:37	deicide-	i'm an heavy torrent user and i want to seed my torrents forever
2018-08-31 00:24:46	rydare	 /dev/sdxX  where x is a letter signifying the physical device, and X is the number of the partition
2018-08-31 00:28:36	deicide-	theres ton of lines and its scarring\discouraging 
2018-08-31 00:28:47	deicide-	especially in that file
2018-08-31 00:29:31	rydare	well you do have 8 drives that it has to display
2018-08-31 00:29:53	rydare	fstab should only have three lines, and some #comments
2018-08-31 00:30:09	rydare	unless you made it more complicated
2018-08-31 00:32:17	deicide-	life is complicated
2018-08-31 00:34:09	rydare	tell you what
2018-08-31 00:34:41	rydare	send me a paste of 'sudo fdisk -l' and your /etc/fstab and i think i figure it out
2018-08-31 00:35:19	deicide-	i'm trying to find how to do it automaticly on google
2018-08-31 00:36:39	deicide-	https://paste.debian.net/hidden/dd15890e/
2018-08-31 00:37:23	rydare	ok /dev/sdc is your 500GB Linux partition, we dont worry about that
2018-08-31 00:38:05	rydare	sdb is your windows drive, we can mount the 5.3TB partition but we shouldn't mount the 128GB Windows partition
2018-08-31 00:38:21	rydare	sdd is 3.7TB, just storage
2018-08-31 00:38:27	rydare	same with sde
2018-08-31 00:38:38	rydare	sdf is a 1TB drive
2018-08-31 00:38:44	deicide-	one of the 6tb drives is the windows
2018-08-31 00:38:53	rydare	right /dev/sdb
2018-08-31 00:39:15	deicide-	well windows is 128gb partition
2018-08-31 00:39:26	rydare	right we shouldn't mount that
2018-08-31 00:39:36	rydare	but we can mount the 5.3TB partition on there
2018-08-31 00:40:22	rydare	do you know what you want to call the drives
2018-08-31 00:40:31	rydare	they need a place to mount in your filesystem
2018-08-31 00:40:43	deicide-	they all have names
2018-08-31 00:40:55	deicide-	download and backup
2018-08-31 00:41:00	deicide-	most of them
2018-08-31 00:41:19	rydare	ok we might have to play around with them
2018-08-31 00:41:22	rydare	if the names are wrong
2018-08-31 00:41:33	rydare	start with, what's the 5.3TB on your windows drive called?
2018-08-31 00:41:42	rydare	we'll mount it in /mnt/something
2018-08-31 00:41:45	rydare	what's the something
2018-08-31 00:42:55	deicide-	backup2(1tb) backup1(1tb) ssd games(1tb) downloads(4tb) war(4tb) downloads(6tb) downloads(6tb)
2018-08-31 00:43:51	deicide-	well the last one should bedownloads but right now its new volume cause i changed it and got windows on that drive
2018-08-31 00:44:00	rydare	ok
2018-08-31 00:44:18	rydare	the thing is, i dont get the labels from fdisk
2018-08-31 00:44:32	rydare	except war
2018-08-31 00:44:40	deicide-	:X
2018-08-31 00:44:48	rydare	but we can change them later
2018-08-31 00:44:52	rydare	if they turn out wrong
2018-08-31 00:45:13	rydare	open up Xfce file manager (Thunar)
2018-08-31 00:45:16	rydare	do they have names there
2018-08-31 00:45:27	deicide-	yes
2018-08-31 00:45:36	rydare	right click and get info
2018-08-31 00:45:44	rydare	does it show you the device?  (/dev/sdxX)
2018-08-31 00:46:20	deicide-	checking backup2
2018-08-31 00:46:23	deicide-	nope
2018-08-31 00:47:22	deicide-	non of them show device
2018-08-31 00:50:07	rydare	ok
2018-08-31 00:50:20	rydare	so unmount all of them for now
2018-08-31 00:50:40	rydare	i had to add numbers to the multiple downloads and backup
2018-08-31 00:51:33	deicide-	done
2018-08-31 00:51:37	rydare	https://paste.debian.net/hidden/1ff78216/
2018-08-31 00:51:45	rydare	see those filepaths?
2018-08-31 00:51:54	rydare	/mnt/downloads .... etc
2018-08-31 00:52:11	rydare	these are where we're going to mount the drives
2018-08-31 00:52:19	rydare	but we need to create the folders 
2018-08-31 00:52:55	rydare	mkdir means "make directory"
2018-08-31 00:52:59	rydare	so go through the list
2018-08-31 00:53:12	rydare	and go 'sudo mkdir /mnt/downloads'
2018-08-31 00:53:20	rydare	then 'sudo mkdir /mnt/downloads2'
2018-08-31 00:53:26	rydare	all the way down the list
2018-08-31 00:56:34	deicide-	i made mistake how do i delete folder?
2018-08-31 00:56:51	rydare	be very careful, because you can delete system files
2018-08-31 00:57:00	rydare	'sudo rm -r /mnt/mistake'
2018-08-31 00:57:12	rydare	the -r means it deletes folders
2018-08-31 00:57:42	rydare	Linux is powerful, if you as the root user tell it to delete the root directory, it will
2018-08-31 00:57:52	rydare	it will keep deleting until it deletes the delete program
2018-08-31 00:58:28	deicide-	LOL
2018-08-31 00:58:41	deicide-	this is better than delete system32
2018-08-31 00:59:11	deicide-	umm can i change drive name in linux?
2018-08-31 00:59:52	rydare	you can name the drive anything you want
2018-08-31 01:00:04	rydare	i was just using your old names
2018-08-31 01:00:05	deicide-	yea but how? 
2018-08-31 01:00:14	deicide-	gparted?
2018-08-31 01:00:24	rydare	i think that tool will do it
2018-08-31 01:00:43	rydare	but you could just mount it to a different location
2018-08-31 01:01:02	deicide-	awesome it comes with linux!
2018-08-31 01:01:58	rydare	yeah manjaro comes with lots of stuff
2018-08-31 01:02:02	rydare	some people don't like that
2018-08-31 01:02:58	deicide-	oh with it i can tell you which is which
2018-08-31 01:03:12	rydare	nice

2018-08-31 01:05:11	deicide-	 /dev/sdc2 downloads
2018-08-31 01:05:25	deicide-	 /dev/ssd1 war

2018-08-31 01:06:42	deicide-	first two are 5tb
2018-08-31 01:06:46	deicide-	6*
2018-08-31 01:06:49	rydare	ok, so only one was wrong
2018-08-31 01:06:50	rydare	cool
2018-08-31 01:06:55	rydare	i've changed them
2018-08-31 01:07:00	rydare	kept the same mount points
2018-08-31 01:07:04	rydare	did you make them all?
2018-08-31 01:08:06	deicide-	made them all
2018-08-31 01:08:09	rydare	nice
2018-08-31 01:08:10	rydare	ok
2018-08-31 01:08:23	rydare	so here's the updated fstab entries https://paste.debian.net/hidden/ecab1414
2018-08-31 01:08:29	deicide-	what was the one wrong?
2018-08-31 01:08:42	rydare	downloads3 and war were confused
2018-08-31 01:09:05	rydare	you're going to want to add those lines to your /etc/fstab file
2018-08-31 01:09:10	rydare	couple of options
2018-08-31 01:09:19	rydare	'sudo mousepad /etc/fstab' for gui
2018-08-31 01:09:27	rydare	'sudo nano /etc/fstab' for terminal
2018-08-31 01:10:02	rydare	make sure you do not touch the lines above, just add those ones
2018-08-31 01:12:45	deicide-	press ctrl+f
2018-08-31 01:12:49	deicide-	hexchat closed
2018-08-31 01:12:51	deicide-	wth?
2018-08-31 01:13:05	rydare	hmm not sure
2018-08-31 01:14:49	deicide-	sudo mousepad /etc/fstab to the config file?
2018-08-31 01:15:08	rydare	it will open /etc/fstab
2018-08-31 01:15:12	rydare	the file we want to edit
2018-08-31 01:15:25	deicide-	ah i already wrote it with nano
2018-08-31 01:15:31	rydare	oh that's fine
2018-08-31 01:15:32	rydare	save it
2018-08-31 01:15:36	rydare	then do 'sudo mount -a'
2018-08-31 01:16:04	deicide-	sudo: mount-a: command not found
2018-08-31 01:16:12	rydare	space between mount and -a
2018-08-31 01:17:07	rydare	shouldn't show anything
2018-08-31 01:17:08	deicide-	how do i unmount them 1 mistake
2018-08-31 01:17:23	rydare	hmm
2018-08-31 01:17:30	rydare	what was the mistake
2018-08-31 01:17:48	deicide-	downloads 6tb and downloads 6tb2
2018-08-31 01:17:57	deicide-	the main is secondary
2018-08-31 01:18:16	rydare	you can do 'sudo umount /mnt/downloads' and 'sudo umount /mnt/downloads2'
2018-08-31 01:18:44	rydare	and then 'sudo nano /etc/fstab'  and swap out sdb5 for sdc2 and vice versa, or move the 2 to the first line
2018-08-31 01:19:21	deicide-	great
2018-08-31 01:19:42	deicide-	thank you
2018-08-31 01:19:49	rydare	no problem
2018-08-31 01:20:26	deicide-	yeah #manjaro is pretty daed
2018-08-31 01:20:29	deicide-	dead
2018-08-31 01:20:50	deicide-	its a shadow in comparison to how great #debian is
2018-08-31 01:22:12	rydare	yeah you can try arch
2018-08-31 01:22:18	rydare	but sometimes they get pissy
2018-08-31 01:22:34	rydare	same with getting support in #ubuntu for distros based on it
2018-08-31 01:22:42	rydare	even if the problems/solutions are the same
2018-08-31 01:23:18	deicide-	you sure its a good idea to let a noob into arch irc chan?
2018-08-31 01:23:38	rydare	lol
2018-08-31 01:23:41	deicide-	i saw some of the linux elitism
2018-08-31 01:23:45	deicide-	its not pretty
2018-08-31 01:24:36	deicide-	saw mods on reddit leaving their role becuase of harassment and stuff
2018-08-31 01:24:48	rydare	on the arch subreddit?  
2018-08-31 01:24:57	deicide-	not arch
2018-08-31 01:25:02	deicide-	cant remember which
2018-08-31 01:25:13	deicide-	few years ago
2018-08-31 01:40:51	rydare	anyways, time for bed

2018-08-31 22:41:24	deicide-	do you agree with this?
2018-08-31 22:42:46	rydare	looks to be an old tutorial
2018-08-31 22:42:48	deicide-	like these commands
2018-08-31 22:42:59	deicide-	9months is the newest
2018-08-31 22:43:09	rydare	i dont know about /etc/init.d
2018-08-31 22:43:17	deicide-	also its the only one
2018-08-31 22:43:21	rydare	you want to use manjaro as a host for other operating systems right?
2018-08-31 22:43:30	deicide-	i want to get into steam
2018-08-31 22:43:43	deicide-	my steam guard is in android vm
2018-08-31 22:45:11	deicide-	yea i know its retarded
2018-08-31 22:45:21	rydare	i've only ever used virtualbox
2018-08-31 22:45:31	deicide-	but i refuse to put 200$ on used android phone
2018-08-31 22:45:37	rydare	but you could basically get away with just 'yay -S vmware-workstation'
2018-08-31 22:45:47	rydare	the phone i'm using cost $100 Canadian dollars
2018-08-31 22:45:58	deicide-	well not even 100
2018-08-31 22:46:12	rydare	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/VMware#Package_build_for_x86_64
2018-08-31 22:46:37	rydare	so 'yay -S vmware-workstation linux-headers'
2018-08-31 22:46:38	deicide-	i have it downloaded from their site
2018-08-31 22:46:41	deicide-	just -U?
2018-08-31 22:46:45	deicide-	pacman -U
2018-08-31 22:46:49	rydare	it's better to get it from the AUR
2018-08-31 22:46:57	deicide-	ok
2018-08-31 22:46:59	rydare	that way it's updatable with pacman/yay
2018-08-31 22:47:09	deicide-	i want workstation-player cause its free
2018-08-31 22:47:19	deicide-	yay -S vmware-workstation-player
2018-08-31 22:47:19	deicide-	==> Error: Could not find all required packages:

2018-08-31 22:47:37	rydare	is regular workstation not free?
2018-08-31 22:47:59	deicide-	no idea
2018-08-31 22:48:03	deicide-	doubt it
2018-08-31 22:48:46	deicide-	thats why i downloaded from their site
2018-08-31 22:49:09	deicide-	i only need it to do simple vm'ing of android vm
2018-08-31 22:49:40	rydare	you should use virtualbox, it's a free program that does the same thing
2018-08-31 22:49:59	rydare	vmware workstation player 14 is $149 it says
2018-08-31 22:50:37	deicide-	no
2018-08-31 22:50:39	deicide-	its free
2018-08-31 22:51:05	deicide-	and no i'm not going to use virtualbox because i don't want to make new vm
2018-08-31 22:51:14	rydare	well the AUR page for vmware-workstation links to workstation player
2018-08-31 22:51:18	rydare	so it's probably the same thing
2018-08-31 22:51:23	deicide-	ok
2018-08-31 22:51:33	rydare	i see a download link but it says you can buy it for $150
2018-08-31 22:51:44	rydare	do you have a license or something
2018-08-31 22:51:56	deicide-	when i loooked and downloaded it didn't say buy anywhere
2018-08-31 22:52:02	deicide-	also its Known to be free
2018-08-31 22:52:27	rydare	well do 'yay -S vmware-workstation'
2018-08-31 22:52:27	deicide-	you need license if you want it for not personal use
2018-08-31 22:52:36	rydare	it'll install all the necessary stuff to make it work
2018-08-31 22:52:39	deicide-	no headers?
2018-08-31 22:52:48	rydare	the package will install headers
2018-08-31 22:52:51	rydare	as a dependency
2018-08-31 22:54:09	deicide-	stupid question but can i close terminal after i started steam?
2018-08-31 22:54:16	deicide-	or its has to has terminal with it
2018-08-31 22:54:23	rydare	try closing the terminal
2018-08-31 22:54:26	rydare	and if steam closes
2018-08-31 22:54:29	rydare	launch it from the menu
2018-08-31 22:54:39	deicide-	yea it closed
2018-08-31 22:54:45	rydare	there's a way to "disown" stuff you launch from the terminal
2018-08-31 22:55:00	deicide-	oh it works now without terminal
2018-08-31 22:55:04	rydare	like say you want to launch steam.. you do 'steam &'
2018-08-31 22:55:12	rydare	and steam will run in the background
2018-08-31 22:55:22	rydare	then you can do 'disown' and it will no longer depend on that terminal
2018-08-31 22:57:54	deicide-	lolwut
2018-08-31 22:58:20	rydare	that's just a way to launch things from terminal
2018-08-31 22:58:23	deicide-	the package manager says i have 32 updates, i already updated and when i open it it says up to date
2018-08-31 22:58:32	deicide-	then why are you red??
2018-08-31 22:58:42	rydare	did you do 'yay -Syu' ?
2018-08-31 22:58:46	deicide-	aye
2018-08-31 22:58:55	deicide-	i saved that command
2018-08-31 22:59:02	deicide-	like you recommended
2018-08-31 22:59:22	rydare	hmm i dunno
2018-08-31 22:59:32	rydare	did you install vmware
2018-08-31 22:59:37	rydare	there's a few steps to do
2018-08-31 23:00:02	deicide-	its still going
2018-08-31 23:00:40	deicide-	i should just go to windows and disable steam guard
2018-08-31 23:00:48	deicide-	ah just finished
2018-08-31 23:01:19	rydare	ok, so enable network for vms 'sudo systemctl enable vmware-networks.service'
2018-08-31 23:01:41	deicide-	Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/vmware-networks.service → /usr/lib/systemd/system/vmware-networks.service.
2018-08-31 23:01:46	rydare	perfect
2018-08-31 23:02:03	rydare	your vm doens't need to directly connect to USB devices right?
2018-08-31 23:02:17	deicide-	nope
2018-08-31 23:02:29	rydare	ok, then just do 'sudo modprobe -a vmw_vmci vmmon'
2018-08-31 23:02:47	deicide-	modprobe: WARNING: Module vmw_vmci not found in directory /lib/modules/4.14.66-1-MANJARO

2018-08-31 23:05:05	deicide-	i kinda feel bad that i don't do any research and just rely on you
2018-08-31 23:05:16	deicide-	thats a bad habit
2018-08-31 23:05:24	rydare	hmm
2018-08-31 23:05:28	rydare	yeah
2018-08-31 23:05:36	rydare	i dont know i dont' mind helping to some extent
2018-08-31 23:05:43	rydare	bored waiting to move tomorrow
2018-08-31 23:05:55	deicide-	although you've been great support so far and helped me a ton
2018-08-31 23:06:21	deicide-	any idea about the files not found?
2018-08-31 23:06:38	rydare	can you scroll up to where it's installing vmware
2018-08-31 23:06:48	deicide-	yes
2018-08-31 23:07:00	rydare	does it say anything about No kernel #.##.#-#-ARCH modules
2018-08-31 23:07:04	deicide-	wall of text
2018-08-31 23:07:18	rydare	copy it to mousepad and search for "modules"
2018-08-31 23:07:55	rydare	ok
2018-08-31 23:07:55	rydare	wiat
2018-08-31 23:07:58	rydare	just reboot
2018-08-31 23:08:06	rydare	i think you got a new kernel with the upgrade you did
2018-08-31 23:08:14	rydare	so it installed the modules for the new kernel
2018-08-31 23:08:30	rydare	#justarchthings
2018-08-31 23:09:46	deicide-	says somewhere in there i need to boot
2018-08-31 23:09:50	deicide-	==> Before using VMware, you need to reboot or load vmw_vmci and vmmon kernel modules (in a terminal on root: modprobe -a vmw_vmci vmmon)
2018-08-31 23:09:51	deicide-	==> You may also need to enable some of these services:
2018-08-31 23:10:09	rydare	yeah try rebooting
2018-08-31 23:10:37	deicide-	just in case

2018-08-31 23:15:13	rydare	we'll have to reinstall vmware once you've rebooted

2018-08-31 23:19:29	rydare	take note of step one where it builds the modules, hopefully it does it this time
2018-08-31 23:19:58	deicide-	there are some downgrades from debian tbh
2018-08-31 23:20:22	deicide-	first grub has no gui(minimal downgrade) and the borders at windows
2018-08-31 23:20:37	deicide-	they are like 1-2 pixels so its really really hard to resize
2018-08-31 23:20:46	rydare	just go into appearance settings
2018-08-31 23:20:50	rydare	tons of themes for Xfwm
