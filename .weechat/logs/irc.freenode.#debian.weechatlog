2018-08-29 17:08:21	ruffni	i have *somehow* messed up my networking configuration on my mbp (BCM43602), now networking service won't start anymore. ifup tries to connect to my local wifi but ends up not getting a response. kernel mentions: "brcmfmac: firmware: failed to load brcm/brcmfmac43602-pcie.txt". brcmfmac shows up in `lsmod`.
2018-08-29 17:08:45	ruffni	any ideas?
2018-08-29 17:11:06	jasabella	onporaâ€¦  you're looking to change your subnet mask to 255.255.255.0  (or 255.0.0.0)

2018-08-29 20:24:54	_alx_	[19:52:53] pretty sure they work for docker
2018-08-29 20:24:54	ilmostro	[19:53:34] might be feasible to have that setup script, at least, available in the official repo for debian stretch ðŸ¤”
2018-08-29 20:24:54	ilmostro	[19:53:56] thanks anyway
2018-08-29 20:24:54	_alx_	[19:54:22] ilmostro: no prob. if you get an answer, let me know. You've made me curious too :P
2018-08-29 20:24:54	ilmostro	[19:55:11] hehe, honestly, I wasn't planning on following up on it :( I had assumed that the discussion would be occurring within the debian team and its irc channel
2018-08-29 20:24:54	ilmostro	[19:55:40] I'm sure they have good reasons for it; I'm not curious enough to find out just now :p
2018-08-29 20:24:54	ilmostro	[19:57:25] perhaps that's something that will occur with time.  Since there's an alternative installation available, it may not be a priority just yet; especially if bigger things are happening at the same time
2018-08-29 20:24:54	ilmostro	[20:00:03] the same version seems to be available in the experimental repo (docker-ce-18.06) as the version provided by upstream docker
2018-08-29 20:24:54	_alx_	[20:00:17] they did have a big migration this summer
2018-08-29 20:24:54	ilmostro	[20:00:41] yeah; that's my theory right now :) may be just a matter of time
2018-08-29 20:24:54	ilmostro	[20:01:15] I suppose I had to talk it out with someone :D
2018-08-29 20:24:54	ilmostro	[20:02:16] thinking is fundamental, even if it's done out loud :p good chat; g2g now
2018-08-29 20:24:54	_alx_	[20:02:28] nice talking to ya man
2018-08-29 20:24:54	on3pk	[20:07:54] Is there a list of how long different versions of debian will be supported?
2018-08-29 20:24:54	on3pk	[20:10:47]  /msg dpkg install stretch

2018-08-29 21:14:13	Ryz3qdsfW4go	does the regular copy command have any "continue from where it left off" functionality?

2018-08-30 06:36:33	blackflow	if libc were missing, no command would've been possible, reboot to reach a state where you can launch steam, included
2018-08-30 06:36:45	RoyK	true
2018-08-30 06:37:04	blackflow	methinks that's the bundled runtime's libc
2018-08-30 06:37:12	jehorn	Thatâ€™s what I was thinking, no libc, nothing would really work.
2018-08-30 06:37:35	RoyK	blackflow: possibly, but if the lib is just missing, you're talking about fs corruption
2018-08-30 06:37:48	davidebeatrici	Hello, I have two monitors: one connected to the integrated graphics card and one to the dedicated one. The integrated graphics card is set as primary in the BIOS, in fact xrandr detects the monitor connected to it, however it doesn't detect the one connected to the dedicated graphics card. Is it possible to use both monitors if they are connected to two different GPUs?
2018-08-30 06:38:49	RoyK	blackflow: unless there was a security hole in steam and someone exploited it - which isn't a good thing either
2018-08-30 06:38:58	blackflow	hmm, there doesn't seem to be a libc in ~/.steam runtime dirs...
2018-08-30 06:39:12	sweepy	if i have some fs corruption would it be best to format and reinstall?

2018-08-30 13:37:58	greycat	I don't know what it means to have both auto *and* allow-hotplug for the same interface.
2018-08-30 13:38:17	empty_string	also, that almost looks like it'd do dhcpv6 instead of slaac which may not be what you want
2018-08-30 13:38:19	greycat	Usually you have one or the other.
2018-08-30 13:38:29	empty_string	"listen for ipv6 addresses from the router" is a little vague

2018-08-30 13:40:11	empty_string	actually this may be a moot point. it looks like slaac is done automatically if you have router advertisements on your network anywhere, so
2018-08-30 13:40:13	julius	not sure, its a default router from my isp. it "sends out" ipv6 adresses

2018-08-30 17:22:18	tripkin	Hello, all. I am running stretch (up to date) with the backports and experimental repo's installed. I installed tor, which installed 0.2.9.15-1. I want to upgrade to a newer version, but whether I specify -t stretch-backports or -t experimental, it always keeps tor at the stable version. Any ideas on what I might be doing wrong?

2018-08-30 17:57:09	detly	I have a bit of an odd problem. I'm running Buster on a Dragonboard (aarch64). I booted from the internal emmc just fine, mmcblk0p10 mounted as /. I then inserted an SD card, it became mmcblk1. However, because /etc/fstab contains an entry for /dev/disk/by-partlabel/rootfs to be mounted at /, and the sd card ALSO has mmcblk1p9 named rootfs, running "mount" now shows /dev/mmcblk1p9 mounted at /
2018-08-30 17:57:42	detly	however... it's not quite...? as in, /home/linaro is clearly the emmc contents
2018-08-30 17:57:55	detly	I can't umount /, because "target is busy"
2018-08-30 17:58:21	detly	I am not clear on (a) what part of the filesystem is what now, and (b) how to safely extricate the sd card
2018-08-30 17:59:04	detly	if I remount /dev/mmcblk1p9 somewhere else, will / then go back to being /dev/mmcblk0p10? or will it just be dangling?

2018-08-30 19:40:40	annadane	it says "will be fixed in next version" though so... hmm...

2018-08-30 19:54:45	Owner	requires physical access, requires an administrator that has no root password set as a smart idea, insalls physlock because they care about security, types sudo for every command ever or sudo su - anyway
2018-08-30 19:54:57	annadane	all right, fair enough.
2018-08-30 19:55:02	annadane	i'm an idiot, then.
2018-08-30 19:55:46	jasabella	when i installed debian, i disabled root login
2018-08-30 19:56:11	Owner	why would you disable root login
2018-08-30 19:56:22	Owner	for an appliance?
2018-08-30 19:56:28	Owner	or an actual system you like
2018-08-30 19:56:33	Owner	lol
2018-08-30 19:56:39	jasabella	it's my laptop, not an actual server
2018-08-30 19:56:50	jasabella	i just sudo as required
2018-08-30 19:58:10	Owner	right, i dont run sudo except to start a root shell
2018-08-30 19:58:30	Owner	i dont like the idea of getting into a habit of typing sudo all the time
2018-08-30 19:58:47	Owner	could make mistakes

2018-08-30 19:59:13	Ether_Man	Hi I'm having a bit of an issue getting openvpn to cooperate with me. See if I launch 'openvpn --config /etc/openvpn/ovpn.conf --daemon' manually, it launches and connects properly to the server. If I launch 'service openvpn start' however, it doesn't. Yet from what I'm reading, it should try every conf file in the openvpn dir, which should include that same ovpn.conf file from what I understand should it not? The service does
2018-08-30 19:59:13	Ether_Man	launch properly and everything and there's no errors that I can see, just no trying to load the config at all :/
2018-08-30 19:59:13	Owner	obviously sudo has other uses
2018-08-30 19:59:17	jasabella	sure
2018-08-30 19:59:22	Owner	which i think are much more enjoyable
2018-08-30 19:59:32	Owner	just my two cents

2018-08-30 20:00:32	Owner	jasabella: i disable root login, but not locally...ever  so yea, for things where there is actual physical access possible, i would always have a root password
2018-08-30 20:00:59	Owner	whether or not you even memorize it
2018-08-30 20:01:13	Owner	or even keep it, because obviously you can just single user mode to fix it anyway

2018-08-31 05:35:51	bites	the ssl is terminated at cdn level, if you use the cdn, no?

2018-08-31 05:37:15	jelly	I thought we covered that bit, and established the one useful security feature https brought to the tabble
2018-08-31 05:37:21	rootkea	petn-randall, But do you agree HTTPS along side GPS sig checking is better?
2018-08-31 05:37:50	jelly	rootkea: no, the only thing better is a MITM can't directly see which packages you're downloading
2018-08-31 05:38:16	jelly	and they can delay patches for 10 days

2018-08-31 06:36:58	petn-randall	The True Wayâ„ â„¢Â®Â©â„— is to understand the underlying issue, and then decide for yourself.
2018-08-31 06:37:24	clackety	there we go, that's how we do it in todays age of intellectual property lol
2018-08-31 06:37:30	Lachezar	Should I ask the system admin to switch the default from 'graphical.target' to 'multi-user.target'? The server has no console anyway.
2018-08-31 06:37:46	tw	My goal is to make xss-lock/i3lock not lock the screen until after 30 seconds of blanking.
2018-08-31 06:38:10	tw	I feel like one of those two should be able to handle that for me.

Based on this - http://lipo.lol/memtest.jpg - would you say it's extremely probable my ram is screwed, I need new ram, not something funky to do with my motherboard or my processor?

2018-08-31 18:00:49	baconicsynergy	I have a question about the recent speculative execution errors in Intel CPUs. Does a complete fix require the non-free repository w/ non-free intel microcode, or is there a fix within the main security updates repository? I really don't want to enable non-free, but I want to be secure. Does anyone have any input on this situation?
