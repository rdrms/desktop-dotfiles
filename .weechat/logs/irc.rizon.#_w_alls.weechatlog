2020-05-13 22:50:29	Whalebot	<T​he Dreaded Monday> How cliche is "Character goes into VR and creates their own realities and is basically in a continuous lucid dream, only for <Insert something going wrong here>"
2020-05-13 22:51:14	Whalebot	<T​he Dreaded Monday> I'm thinking that they'd know what's happening IRL to an extent by watching the news and reading the IRL mirror for Wikipedia
2020-05-13 22:52:35	Whalebot	<T​he Dreaded Monday> But at the same time they can't read anything that's not on a computer somewhere, so I imagine one potential conflict would be that they find all the computers have had no new information for a couple days and then realize, well...why
2020-05-13 22:53:02	Whalebot	<T​he Dreaded Monday> Wait this sounds exactly like something I wrote a while back.
2020-05-13 22:53:08	Whalebot	<T​he Dreaded Monday> Damn, why did I abandon it again?

2020-05-14 01:20:14	Whalebot	<T​he Dreaded Monday> Well that's what I mean
2020-05-14 01:20:53	Whalebot	<T​he Dreaded Monday> If suddenly absolutely nothing new appears on computers for five days, you start to realize something is wrong
2020-05-14 01:28:54	Whalebot	<V​alen> Oh I see
2020-05-14 01:29:00	Whalebot	<V​alen> Yeah probably within a day
