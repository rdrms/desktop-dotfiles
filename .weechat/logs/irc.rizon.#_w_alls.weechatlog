2018-08-22 11:21:10	&Foom	[10:56:32] kyubiko, totally forgot about that lmao
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&Foom	[10:56:48] problem is you're up in bumfuck nowhere which is long to travel to from bristol
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&Foom	[10:57:03] actually if you're in sheff that's not far from LC
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&kyubiko	[10:57:11] Foom: oh are you not in Leicester over early sept
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&kyubiko	[10:57:21] Tomoko_A_Best: my term ends on the last October
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&Foom	[10:57:22] Tomoko_A_Best, >thinking you're gonna learn moon
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&Foom	[10:57:33] kyubiko, yeah i'm here till mid to late sept
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&kyubiko	[10:57:34] starts again January 14th
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&kyubiko	[10:57:50] I'm thinking of doing an optional language module next year
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&kyubiko	[10:57:55] brush up on my German
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&kyubiko	[10:58:09] I met my mentors for Google Summer of Code the other day who are both German
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&kyubiko	[10:58:27] and it was kinda embarrassing I'd completely forgotten how to speak it so we had to do everything in English
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&kyubiko	[10:58:37] oh yeah I passed google summer of code btw so I'm fucking loaded
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&kyubiko	[10:58:39] good feel
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&Foom	[10:59:12] kyubiko, were you ever actually decent at german
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&Foom	[10:59:25] what do you mean loaded do you mean they payed you lots of skrilla
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&Foom	[10:59:32] or you can put it on a cv to earn skrilla
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&kyubiko	[11:00:16] I mean they paid me
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&kyubiko	[11:00:25] Foom: I wouldn't go as far as "decent"
2018-08-22 11:21:10	Fogun	[11:00:34] By loaded he means he has more than $100 in his bank as a student.
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&kyubiko	[11:00:56] but I went to Germany for 2 weeks and could actually hold conversations with people
2018-08-22 11:21:10	@Tomoko_A_Best	[11:00:56] Foom: I will
2018-08-22 11:21:10	@Tomoko_A_Best	[11:00:58] just you wait!
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&kyubiko	[11:00:59] if a little stunted
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&Foom	[11:01:09] kyubiko, uthat's decent
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&Foom	[11:01:14] Tomoko_A_Best, haha sure
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&Foom	[11:01:18] kyubiko, how much did they pay you
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&kyubiko	[11:01:27] Foom: the final payment was Â£2k
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&Foom	[11:01:32] fuck my life
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&kyubiko	[11:01:33] but they'd paid me twice before that already
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&kyubiko	[11:01:36] and I'm getting paid for the other job
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&Foom	[11:01:55] i've forgotten cause i've asked this before but what did you have to do for the summer of code
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&kyubiko	[11:02:11] improve the encryption module for a chat client
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&Foom	[11:02:15] also can you shoot me some p cause i'm getting a bit itght in the belt down here
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&Foom	[11:02:22] *tight
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&kyubiko	[11:02:26] https://github.com/dino/dino/pull/413
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&Foom	[11:03:23] kyubiko, you're so much more competent than me i swear lmao
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&kyubiko	[11:03:53] Foom: nah I just went into a field where it's piss easy to get paid reasonable money
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&kyubiko	[11:04:10] and not a day goes by where I don't regret how fucking dry it all is
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&Foom	[11:04:46] but all i do is play video games and drink beer
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&kyubiko	[11:07:37] pretty much same just very occasionally I realise I haven't done any work and stay up all night typing letters into a computer and then get given some money for it
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&kyubiko	[11:08:06] Foom: to be honest though there are so many reasons why I'd be unable to do a humanities degree and I'm kinda in awe of those that do well in them
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&kyubiko	[11:08:21] which is a shame cos honestly humanities subjects are probably on the whole more interesting than what I'm doing lol
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&Foom	[11:10:09] science is for nerds lol
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&kyubiko	[11:10:12] My little brother is going off to do English and he knows so much about all that artsy shit and I'm kinda jealous of that
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&kyubiko	[11:10:31] At least I can claim to be responsible for introducing him to music
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&Foom	[11:10:38] art is good
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&kyubiko	[11:11:46] I agree I just know shit all about any of it
2018-08-22 11:21:10	&kyubiko	[11:12:03] I don't even read that much any more

2018-08-22 16:45:49	~Scope10	You can also try something like Phonograph

2018-08-22 16:46:53	&Discord-Relay	<DJ_Arghlex> i'll try some shit and if it keeps up maybe i'll see about rooting it then trying a more aggressive solution
2018-08-22 16:47:47	~Scope10	It might just be the battery optimization killing the app somehow

2018-08-24 17:21:52	sky	that can't be right

2018-08-24 17:22:12	sky	i've used it over rdp without a monitor attached to the machine
2018-08-24 17:22:30	vuk	it's currently seeding torrents on two clients at once
2018-08-24 17:22:55	vuk	it's basically fucked, but i can't really bother to clean it inside out because private trackers
2018-08-24 17:23:18	sky	i switched to transmission-daemon a few years back and stuck with that ever since
2018-08-24 17:23:53	vuk	so since i own two(2) thinkpads now i thought to myself, well gee, there's no use of this piece of desktop junk for me now except seeding
2018-08-24 17:24:22	vuk	so i just installed anydesk+teamviewer as backup, and removed mouse, keyboard and monitor
2018-08-24 17:24:30	vuk	turns out firefox gives out a blank screen
2018-08-24 17:24:37	vuk	same with qbittorrent
2018-08-24 17:25:01	vuk	but only if it detects there's no monitor connected to the pc
2018-08-24 17:25:14	vuk	i actually tested that out and it pissed me off so much
2018-08-24 17:25:34	vuk	i kinda feel like writing a bug report but i also have a feel it won't gain any traction at all
2018-08-24 17:25:56	sky	maybe there's a way to turn off gpu acceleration?
2018-08-24 17:25:57	vuk	because what fucking nerd runs windows 10 without a monitor
2018-08-24 17:26:04	vuk	maybe

2018-08-25 18:59:24	@Tomoko_A_Best	I wonder if I should listen to the desktop thread guy and change the inactive titlebar color
2018-08-25 19:00:12	@Tomoko_A_Best	what do you think bixxx https://sr.ht/I17l.png
2018-08-25 19:01:53	%bixxx	i'd probably change it
2018-08-25 19:02:06	%bixxx	since the inactive windows look like there's something missing up top
2018-08-25 19:02:18	%bixxx	with all that space from the titlebar 
2018-08-25 19:02:47	@Tomoko_A_Best	yeah
2018-08-25 19:02:56	@Tomoko_A_Best	maybe a lighter shade of gray
2018-08-25 19:03:05	@Tomoko_A_Best	I think dark purple would look bad
2018-08-25 19:04:45	@Tomoko_A_Best	https://sr.ht/D2rr.png ?
2018-08-25 19:05:03	%bixxx	i'd change it to the same purple that you have on active windows
2018-08-25 19:05:14	%bixxx	and change the active window titlebar to a neon pink
2018-08-25 19:05:36	@Tomoko_A_Best	I'd think that would clash really badly on fullscreen windows
2018-08-25 19:06:04	@Tomoko_A_Best	well actually, it's not that bad
2018-08-25 19:06:07	%bixxx	probably
2018-08-25 19:06:17	%bixxx	but my rice has stayed the same for like the past 3 years
2018-08-25 19:06:23	%bixxx	and a lot of the colors clash with one another
2018-08-25 19:06:42	@Tomoko_A_Best	https://sr.ht/D_98.png
2018-08-25 19:06:46	@Tomoko_A_Best	I could just keep them all the same color
2018-08-25 19:06:52	@Tomoko_A_Best	I used to do that
2018-08-25 19:07:13	%bixxx	that's what i do on my ubuntu install for the x200 i have at work
2018-08-25 19:07:37	@Tomoko_A_Best	yeah I guess I'll just keep it like this
2018-08-25 19:07:47	%bixxx	and the titlebars are the same color as the term background
2018-08-25 19:07:47	@Tomoko_A_Best	but I'm too lazy to retake the workflow webm I made
2018-08-25 19:08:00	%bixxx	and both of those colors are the same as color as the solid color wallpaper lol
2018-08-25 19:08:51	%bixxx	i think i have a screenshot of it on

2018-08-25 19:26:04	@Tomoko_A_Best	I'm either increasing from 15mg to 20mg or going to prozac
2018-08-25 19:26:18	@Tomoko_A_Best	since cipralex isn't doing anything for my anxiety and is making me more depressed
2018-08-25 19:27:44	%mobo	get on that zoloft
