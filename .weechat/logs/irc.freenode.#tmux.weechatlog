2021-02-11 21:17:11	rdr	if C is control and M is alt, what is Super_L or the Windows key in the config?

2021-02-11 21:20:10	genevino	rdr: i doubt you can use the windows key as a modifier in terminal applications. well, at least my guess is the application in the terminal won't see those.
2021-02-11 21:21:31	rdr	oh really? that's a shame
2021-02-11 21:22:09	genevino	can't say for sure, but i've never in my life seen a setup where that was a thing.

2021-02-11 21:22:49	rdr	I guess that's why all the terminal application I use appear to be obsessed with alt
2021-02-11 21:23:24	genevino	well i still use alt instead of win for all my window manager shortcuts
2021-02-11 21:23:30	genevino	for the simply reason of ergonomics
2021-02-11 21:23:39	genevino	it's much easier to reach with my left thumb
2021-02-11 21:24:07	genevino	of course it's hard to come up with a setup where these two worlds aren't colliding, but for me it was worth it
2021-02-11 21:25:30	genevino	in fact, my whole setup doesn't even utilize the windows key anymore
2021-02-11 21:29:10	rdr	maybe you're just biased lol
2021-02-11 21:29:25	rdr	maybe it wasn't possible in 1984 so you've just avoided the key :P
2021-02-11 21:32:45	genevino	no it just turned out to hurt my left hand
2021-02-11 21:34:50	rdr	ooh i see
2021-02-11 21:34:52	rdr	that's too bad
