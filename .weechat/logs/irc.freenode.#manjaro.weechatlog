2018-08-22 16:12:43	quetzal2	yes. But then generally, I find the environment tools awesome, like Kate, Dolphin, Konsole, … and Krita is excellent.
2018-08-22 16:12:45	quetzal2	If only Calligra could get a boost like Krita had.
2018-08-22 16:14:45	Neeknaim	yes, but I doubt it. Because krita was the prominent player in its field, so a lot of people supported it. People don't really need calligra because they have LO. Unless they are obsessed with qt code/gui :P
2018-08-22 16:14:46	quetzal2	And I forgot Okular too, in the list of the environment tools I really like.
2018-08-22 16:15:07	quetzal2	:D Yes, right.

2018-08-22 16:19:05	quetzal2	That's weird. ever tried to run plasmashell from a terminal and read the messages?

2018-08-22 16:39:46	Neeknaim	Well, lots of errors, but I can't understand what's causing them.
2018-08-22 16:40:25	quetzal2	and did you have a freeze meanwhile?
2018-08-22 16:40:55	Neeknaim	yes
2018-08-22 16:42:02	quetzal2	ok, but too many errors …
2018-08-22 16:42:04	Neeknaim	The system tray stopped responding: There was no media-player icon, I closed vlc after playing a video and it was still in the system-tray but I couldn't close it from there.
2018-08-22 16:42:25	Neeknaim	This mainly happens when playing video/music.

2018-08-22 16:43:25	quetzal2	So it might be related to a specific icon, and thus app.
2018-08-22 16:44:03	Neeknaim	I'll try testing with breeze (although I like maia icons).

2018-08-22 17:19:02	quetzal2	there's a thing with connecting going on right now.
2018-08-22 17:19:29	quetzal2	By the way, by icon I meant the presence of an app. So the icon and the actions it sends to the tray (right click & co).
2018-08-22 17:20:04	Neeknaim	I tried changing to breeze
2018-08-22 17:20:09	franz3r	hey guys, i have a problem with my brand new manjaro installation. i installed the newest manjaro xfce (17.1.12) and i got the following error message for an half second in grub: "error: file 'boot/grub/locale/de.gmo' not found". i allways did sudo grub-install; sudo update-grub; but it does not helped at all. could some one help me? also searched on google and the manjaro forum but can't find an working solution..
2018-08-22 17:20:29	Neeknaim	Playing a video in vlc works (I get the media player applet), but then closing vlc - closes vlc, but it's still "stuck" in the system-tray and the media-player applet is on "stop" icon. Right clicking vlc and choosing "quit" isn't doing anything.
2018-08-22 17:20:41	Neeknaim	Sometimes it closes and sometimes it hangs.
2018-08-22 17:21:45	Neeknaim	And it seems that the media-player icons problem is detailed here (it was happening for me with maia and not breath, probably because no-one fixed the missing maia icons): https://forum.manjaro.org/t/kde-breath-theme-missing-icons/51644
2018-08-22 17:22:02	quetzal2	Neeknaim: hey, now it rings a bell. I think I once must have had something like this, because I then changed the default of vlc to quit when closed.
2018-08-22 17:22:29	quetzal2	(vlc not closing)
2018-08-22 17:23:56	Neeknaim	Oh, that's a smart idea! where do I change the default to quit?

2018-08-22 17:30:29	quetzal2	Neeknaim: maybe run vlc from the terminal and hope for a freeze :)
2018-08-22 17:30:40	Neeknaim	It seems that after killing vlc and relaunching it - when I close it with the x button it quits

2018-08-22 17:32:19	quetzal2	It looks like there isn't any close on quit option (anymore), so those are definitely bugs.
2018-08-22 17:32:27	quetzal2	no problem :)
2018-08-22 17:33:02	Neeknaim	btw, do you use an email client?
2018-08-22 17:34:29	quetzal2	I used KMail (too bad that there are some weird things happening sometimes), and then settled on Thunderbird. Right now though, I'm using the web client temporarily.
2018-08-22 17:36:28	akko	qwerqwerqwerty
2018-08-22 17:36:32	Neeknaim	Were you ever able to make kmail only download emails that are smaller than X kb? In thunderbird it's easy to do, but it seems that kmail lacks that option!
2018-08-22 17:39:09	quetzal2	I never used that option, so no :) But I didn't stumble upon it either, so it might be lacking.
2018-08-22 17:42:11	Neeknaim	I should probably stop searching for it then :)

2018-08-22 22:58:36	Recnamoruen	Hello, I'm trying to get Manjaro to show the non-free drivers in the hardware detection screen, but all it shows is the open-source driver button. Is there a way to get it to show the proprietary button. All the sceenshoots i've seen say it should be there
2018-08-22 23:00:26	rydare	Recnamoruen: what card do you have

2018-08-22 23:03:37	rydare	are you playing 3d games?  the AMD open source drivers are pretty good
2018-08-22 23:03:40	rydare	and recommended
2018-08-22 23:03:50	rydare	i can help you get the proprietary ones though
2018-08-22 23:04:57	Recnamoruen	How do I install the amd open source ones
2018-08-22 23:05:04	Recnamoruen	Thats AMDGPU right?
2018-08-22 23:05:18	rydare	you're probably running the open source ones right now
2018-08-22 23:05:25	rydare	unless you selected non-free during the install
2018-08-22 23:05:33	Recnamoruen	Will they just show up as video-linux?
2018-08-22 23:05:42	rydare	they're included in that package
2018-08-22 23:06:35	rydare	are you having any graphics issues, or are you just trying to be sure
2018-08-22 23:08:30	Recnamoruen	Just trying to be sure,  I'm just starting out because of the changes to steam play with the compatibility modules they just released
2018-08-22 23:08:47	Recnamoruen	so I'm trying to make sure i have the most up to date drivers
2018-08-22 23:08:52	rydare	well AMD has a different philosophy than nvidia
2018-08-22 23:09:05	rydare	so the open source drivers have much better documentation, and are generally better
2018-08-22 23:09:15	rydare	i have nvidia, so i bascailly am forced to use the non-free driver
2018-08-22 23:10:28	rydare	then again, i don't have AMD so I don't know for sure
2018-08-22 23:10:47	Recnamoruen	Ah
2018-08-22 23:11:15	Recnamoruen	Was going to ask if you knew if the amdgpu-pro was worth installing
2018-08-22 23:12:46	Recnamoruen	Nm, looks like it isn't
2018-08-22 23:12:52	Recnamoruen	Rydare: Thanks for the help!
2018-08-22 23:13:07	rydare	no problem

2018-08-23 07:06:41	Caldazar	how do I switch from grub to refind? Tried running refind-install, bu it still uses grub
2018-08-23 07:07:13	RobinSohn	as far as i can see, that code has been implemented to the package installer. so, on the one hand side, i don't understand that code - why should pgp key validations be skipped? on the other hand side, why does the install process check it anyway and leads to a failure because of an unknown public key? i don't get it...

2018-08-24 08:30:02	batch	you may need some x11 askpass package joemaro 
2018-08-24 08:31:11	joemaro	ok i'll try to find out what that is
2018-08-24 08:31:43	batch	yeah it's to prompt you with some gui where virt-manager ask for password 
2018-08-24 08:33:04	joemaro	my problem is that 'systemctl start libvirtd.service' isn't starting the service
2018-08-24 08:33:45	joemaro	libvirtd.service: Start request repeated too quickly

2018-08-24 08:34:12	joemaro	is what systemctl status libvirtd.service says (amongst other unhelpful stuff)
2018-08-24 08:34:19	batch	sudo systemctl restart libvirtd 
2018-08-24 08:34:27	batch	if you need to do it manually
2018-08-24 08:34:49	joemaro	did this countless times
2018-08-24 08:34:51	batch	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/libvirt#Daemon joemaro 
2018-08-24 08:35:10	batch	do it carefully
2018-08-24 08:35:14	joemaro	yes thats what i followed
2018-08-24 08:35:20	batch	it requires particular pattern
2018-08-24 08:35:23	batch	hmm
2018-08-24 08:35:32	batch	should work
2018-08-24 08:35:38	batch	let me see what package i meant
2018-08-24 08:35:41	joemaro	maybe i'll do that ... remove the config files and reinstall
2018-08-24 08:36:31	batch	i think it is this: x11-ssh-askpass
2018-08-24 08:36:41	batch	atleast that's what i used at a friends computer
2018-08-24 08:36:54	batch	and add yourself to libvirt group
2018-08-24 08:37:33	joemaro	the askpass package doesnt change the error (no password is asked) and i added myself to the group
2018-08-24 08:38:02	batch	when did you add yourself to the group joemaro ?
2018-08-24 08:38:26	joemaro	earlier, maybe 2 hours ago or so
2018-08-24 08:38:34	batch	did you reboot after that or not?
2018-08-24 08:38:39	joemaro	yes
2018-08-24 08:38:40	batch	or logout and login again?
2018-08-24 08:38:43	batch	awh
2018-08-24 08:39:29	batch	does it work to start it via commandline joemaro ?
2018-08-24 08:39:40	batch	run*
2018-08-24 08:39:56	joemaro	the service won't start, no
2018-08-24 08:40:23	joemaro	for example: virsh -c qemu:///system     shows that the daemon isn't running
2018-08-24 08:41:31	batch	is virtualization enabled in bios joemaro ?
2018-08-24 08:42:05	joemaro	given that i want to run windows95 with virt-manager only locally, would a 'user-session' be enough for that?
2018-08-24 08:42:16	batch	maybe you need
2018-08-24 08:42:24	batch	sudo systemctl daemon-reload
2018-08-24 08:42:38	batch	then restart the service again and check for eventual error
2018-08-24 08:43:36	joemaro	batch, not sure, i checked for 'vmx' in /proc/cpuinfo and it shows
2018-08-24 08:44:02	batch	better check that all out
2018-08-24 08:44:06	batch	i mean
2018-08-24 08:44:29	batch	make sure it's all enabled in bios and maybe some other stuff in linux
2018-08-24 08:45:27	batch	oh right
2018-08-24 08:45:34	joemaro	here's the output of systemctl status libvirtd.service   : https://bpaste.net/raw/0fd79bfec649
2018-08-24 08:45:36	batch	you may need additional module
2018-08-24 08:45:38	batch	virtio
2018-08-24 08:45:45	batch	that one thing i forgot
2018-08-24 08:46:05	batch	joemaro : lsmod | grep virtio
2018-08-24 08:46:31	joemaro	... empty :(
2018-08-24 08:46:42	batch	that's the one thing you probably need
2018-08-24 08:47:03	joemaro	is that a hardware feature?
2018-08-24 08:47:07	batch	try sudo modprobe virtio and then lsmod | grep virtio
2018-08-24 08:47:18	batch	maybe it's in manjaro but not ready enabled
2018-08-24 08:47:23	batch	i forgot
2018-08-24 08:47:45	batch	it's a kernelmodule
2018-08-24 08:48:08	joemaro	it shows up now
2018-08-24 08:48:21	batch	oke restart the libvirt service again etc
2018-08-24 08:48:56	joemaro	same results :(
2018-08-24 08:49:20	joemaro	couldn't i just disable authentification in /etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf ?
2018-08-24 08:49:36	joemaro	i tried earlier but it didn't make a difference i think
2018-08-24 08:49:43	batch	you know what

2018-08-24 08:49:52	batch	add virtio in /etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf
2018-08-24 08:49:56	batch	then reboot the pc
2018-08-24 08:50:08	batch	and try starting the service again
2018-08-24 08:50:21	batch	pc or server whatever
2018-08-24 08:50:37	batch	maybe enable all the services you want to make it work at boot directly
2018-08-24 08:50:42	joemaro	i just had virtio running and it didnt make a difference, but i'll try
2018-08-24 08:51:02	joemaro	see you later :)

2018-08-24 08:56:41	batch	weird yes
2018-08-24 08:57:47	batch	you have all required packages for server aswell as client joemaro ?
2018-08-24 09:02:46	batch	did you update your entire system aswell as the keychains for manjaro and archlinux joemaro ?
2018-08-24 09:04:18	joemaro	hmm maybe not batch ... i can't update the whole system atm, i don't have enough bandwidth... it's about 1 month since my last pacman -Syu
2018-08-24 09:05:27	joemaro	i'll try to update the keychain thing, can't remember exactly how to do that though
2018-08-24 09:07:27	batch	most of the time i do : sudo pacman -Syyu && sudo pacman-key --init && sudo pacman-key --populate && sudo pacman-key --refresh-keys manjaro archlinux && sudo pacman -Syyu
2018-08-24 09:08:58	batch	that will first update, then check for keychain updates in seperate process and then update again to make sure new maintainers and updates are available

2018-08-24 09:10:33	joemaro	but these keys are only relevant in relation to the pacman packages right? they're not related to certificates that libvirt is using for example?
2018-08-24 09:11:32	batch	i just found some article where someone says it can be complicated like where the system is running some stuff on sockets and interfaces
2018-08-24 09:12:03	batch	for example where the system tries to make a virtual NIC for the hypervisor
2018-08-24 09:12:30	batch	and some things might be missing from dependencies i think
2018-08-24 09:12:34	batch	not entirely sure

2018-08-24 09:13:10	joemaro	i think i saw that one earlier yes
2018-08-24 09:13:27	batch	so yeah
2018-08-24 09:13:45	batch	if it didn't work with those steps you should try the command i gave
2018-08-24 09:13:47	joemaro	oh man i would love to get this running ... but i'll need more time it seems :)
2018-08-24 09:14:04	batch	then just stop and start the service or entirely remove and reinstall it like you said
2018-08-24 09:14:10	batch	ye
2018-08-24 09:14:17	joemaro	or more bandwidth :P ... thanks a lot batch for all the help!

2018-08-24 10:58:34	minted	mtn: giggity
2018-08-24 10:58:52	mtn	minted: in my experience, the problem is caused by manjaro giving wrong info to another distros grub. 
2018-08-24 10:59:20	mtn	minted: I have never seen another distros grub able to boot into manjaro. maybe someone here knows a fix for it
2018-08-24 10:59:38	minted	mtn: likely due to open_rc 'comms' with sys.d yes???
2018-08-24 10:59:41	mtn	minted: the easiest thing to do is let majaro install the grub
2018-08-24 11:00:13	mtn	minted: nope, nothing to do with those. it is the entry for manjaro points to the wrong id in the grub file
2018-08-24 11:00:14	minted	mtn: indeed just dont want to purge the whole thing ya know...
2018-08-24 11:00:41	mtn	minted: nothing to purge, just install grub from manjaro
2018-08-24 11:01:05	mtn	minted: you know: grub-install /dev/sda, for instance if you only have one drive
2018-08-24 11:01:21	minted	mtn: how when manjaro wont boot up...drop to virtual terminal???

2018-08-24 11:03:47	mtn	minted: if you install another os, make sure that it does not write grub to the hard drive, or you will  need to do this again ;)
2018-08-24 11:04:06	minted	mtn: manjaro 'factory' made disc wont bootup either - its a sys.d_64 version
2018-08-24 11:04:27	gpunk	Nixola what does mhwd-kernel -li    lists ?
2018-08-24 11:04:30	mtn	minted: how did you install manjaro in the first place?
2018-08-24 11:04:36	minted	mtn: checked boot order it was right
2018-08-24 11:05:05	minted	mtn: ha! welll...it WORKED then ha!
2018-08-24 11:05:17	mtn	minted: so what did you change? something in the bios settings?
2018-08-24 11:05:33	minted	mtn: nope.
2018-08-24 11:05:44	mtn	minted: well, you change something. the disk, the settings, etc.
2018-08-24 11:05:54	minted	mtn: why my confusion
2018-08-24 11:06:25	minted	mtn: nope.
2018-08-24 11:06:59	mtn	minted: if nothing changed, then the hardware has a problem, but I doubt it 
2018-08-24 11:07:23	mtn	minted: anyway, you will need a manjaro boot disk that actually boots
2018-08-24 11:07:27	minted	mtn: yeah me too mint_mate runs fine
2018-08-24 11:07:50	minted	mtn: LMAO
2018-08-24 11:08:14	minted	mtn:THAT. will be helpful
2018-08-24 11:08:23	mtn	minted: this problem is why I won't run manjaro on any dual boot system
2018-08-24 11:08:28	Nixola	gpunk: linux416 and linux419 (which I installed manually since mhwd-kernel wouldn't)
2018-08-24 11:08:38	Nixola	I also have 417 installed via the AUR package linux-vfio
2018-08-24 11:10:03	minted	mtn: yeah i hear ya ty for trying youre always helpful and patient appreciate you...
2018-08-24 11:10:12	gpunk	how did you update the repo ?
2018-08-24 11:10:15	mtn	minted: welcome. 
2018-08-24 11:10:20	gpunk	i always do pcamn -Syyuu

2018-08-24 11:10:36	mtn	minted: good luck ;)
2018-08-24 11:10:51	Nixola	gpunk: using yay, but mhwd-kernel does -Syyu or -Syyuu by itself
2018-08-24 11:11:02	minted	mtn: try not. do or do not...
2018-08-24 11:11:10	gpunk	hmm i am not sure a bout that
2018-08-24 11:11:56	gpunk	try first pacman -Syyuu , then give it a shot
2018-08-24 11:12:11	Nixola	gpunk: running pacman -Syyuu changed nothing
2018-08-24 11:13:05	gpunk	what kernel are running ? you should remove the unused ones and give it a shot :)
2018-08-24 11:13:20	Nixola	already did
2018-08-24 11:14:01	gpunk	so mhwd-kernel -li show only one kernel ?
2018-08-24 11:14:09	Nixola	I'm running 417 (vfio), I run 416 when I don't need the vfio patches (although I guess I could install 417 or 418 instead), I wanted to test 419 which is why I installed it

2018-08-24 19:43:16	batch	what language do you speak?
2018-08-24 19:43:31	batch	because there are some other manjaro channels in freenode too
2018-08-24 19:43:55	batch	maybe easier to talk in channel in your own language cause i don't understand :p

2018-08-24 20:19:45	Aph3x-WL	did you try removing manjaro-gnome-extension-settings?

2018-08-24 20:21:31	minted	Aph3x-WL, what about installing another d.e. and trying it? but the cli is 'king' so will it matter?

2018-08-24 20:22:42	Aph3x-WL	i have no idea what that last part is supposed to mean but if you can't use the package manager you won't be able to install another desktop
2018-08-24 20:23:31	minted	Aph3x-WL, i was able to install an indiv. pkg earlier i'll try to do xfce
2018-08-24 20:23:55	Aph3x-WL	if you can't update then installing other packages is not a good idea
2018-08-24 20:24:02	Aph3x-WL	that'll lead to further breakage
2018-08-24 20:25:27	Aph3x-WL	what did you install earlier?

2018-08-24 20:26:27	minted	Aph3x-WL, damn really? i was off doing it and it installed xfce4 100% 'so it says' = earlier qbittorrent
2018-08-24 20:28:02	Aph3x-WL	so you installed the gnome iso and installed xfce and qbittorrent on it?

2018-08-25 02:01:44	precla	by 'completely disable' i mean that no current flows to it
2018-08-25 02:02:04	precla	since i have manjaro, the part of my notebook ,where the gpu is, gets warm, even tho i do not use the gpu
2018-08-25 02:02:21	precla	whereas on windows it wasn't warm until some program explicitly used the gpu

2018-08-25 02:10:30	mike-zal	it shouldn't be
2018-08-25 02:10:54	mike-zal	by default on hybrid gpus manjaro installs bumblebee and it uses intel to run desktop
2018-08-25 02:11:21	mike-zal	some system confs are incorrect in your case
2018-08-25 02:11:26	precla	ok, i doubt it's the dokcing sation with 2 external monitors, sice the gpu part gets warm even when the laptop is not on the dock
2018-08-25 02:12:06	mike-zal	precla: read about bbswitch and bumblebee on arch wiki
2018-08-25 02:12:17	precla	i am, this one: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bumblebee#Power_management
2018-08-25 02:12:54	mike-zal	yeah, this one.
2018-08-25 02:13:33	mike-zal	somehow you have nvidia started with a boot, you can disable it
2018-08-25 02:14:05	mike-zal	not sure how relevant this is but a nice info about bbswitch is on nvidia-xrun arch wiki article
2018-08-25 02:14:40	mike-zal	so check if those commands would work for you: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Nvidia-xrun#Use_bbswitch_to_manage_nvidia
2018-08-25 02:14:44	precla	if i could get my head around it how to do it 
2018-08-25 02:15:19	mike-zal	there is a command to disable bbswitch on boot in this article
2018-08-25 02:15:24	precla	"echo 'options bbswitch load_state=0 unload_state=1' > /etc/modprobe.d/bbswitch.conf "
2018-08-25 02:15:32	precla	this iirc
2018-08-25 02:15:45	mike-zal	I suspect this is a general info and should work regardless if you are on nvidia-xrun or not
2018-08-25 02:16:09	mike-zal	yeah, this command
2018-08-25 02:16:16	mike-zal	try it out
2018-08-25 02:16:22	precla	i did, now i have to reboot
2018-08-25 02:16:28	precla	brb
2018-08-25 02:16:30	mike-zal	precla: also use this to disable card now
2018-08-25 02:16:38	precla	what?
2018-08-25 02:16:41	mike-zal	sudo tee /proc/acpi/bbswitch <<<OFF
2018-08-25 02:16:55	mike-zal	then you can check if the card is on or not
2018-08-25 02:17:04	precla	cat /proc/acpi/bbswitch
2018-08-25 02:17:05	mike-zal	then you can reboot and check the same
2018-08-25 02:17:08	precla	still says ON
2018-08-25 02:17:13	precla	but i haven't rebooted yet
2018-08-25 02:17:29	precla	sec (i hope it will boot, otherwise i'll be back in a few hrs hah)
2018-08-25 02:17:30	mike-zal	hmm.. ok, reboot and check. if not, you will try something different ;P
2018-08-25 02:17:36	mike-zal	ok
2018-08-25 02:17:43	precla	i have znc, so my nick will be here..
2018-08-25 02:17:52	mike-zal	I hope your intel works fine
2018-08-25 02:18:00	mike-zal	if not, you may have issues to boot... :P
2018-08-25 02:18:10	mike-zal	messing with driver settings is always a risk
2018-08-25 02:18:24	mike-zal	I hope you know how to use tty to fix things if needed
2018-08-25 02:20:35	precla	back
2018-08-25 02:20:41	precla	reboot worked, nvidia gpu still ON
2018-08-25 02:21:41	precla	ls /etc/modprobe.d/
2018-08-25 02:21:41	precla	bbswitch.conf  mhwd-bbswitch.conf  mhwd-nvidia.conf
2018-08-25 02:21:50	precla	maybe i pasted in wrong conf file?
2018-08-25 02:22:25	precla	cat /etc/modprobe.d/mhwd-bbswitch.conf
2018-08-25 02:22:30	precla	options bbswitch load_state=0 unload_state=0
2018-08-25 02:22:32	precla	hmmm
2018-08-25 02:22:43	precla	maybe i have to change it in this file?
2018-08-25 02:23:22	precla	and if something goes wrong, revert the config? 
2018-08-25 02:27:09	mike-zal	ah, that
2018-08-25 02:27:28	mike-zal	ah, that's probable since arch don't have mhwd so the command is different
2018-08-25 02:27:43	mike-zal	yeah, just in case do the config backup
2018-08-25 02:27:47	precla	now i changed it and i will reboot, but before that
2018-08-25 02:28:07	precla	if bootup doesn't work, i should be able to end up in a terminal and revert it?
2018-08-25 02:28:20	mike-zal	yeah, if you know how to use tty
2018-08-25 02:28:29	mike-zal	ctrl+alt+f2
2018-08-25 02:28:45	mike-zal	log in and do the terminal magic
2018-08-25 02:28:56	precla	ok, thanks
2018-08-25 02:29:30	mike-zal	probably on manjaro forum you will get better guidance, I'm not an expert in the matter.

2018-08-25 02:29:43	mike-zal	always
2018-08-25 02:30:02	l885	i need information regarding web apps performance on latest linux browser release
2018-08-25 02:30:08	l885	i'm planning to switch back to linux
2018-08-25 02:30:18	mike-zal	some are active, some aren't. usually you can wait few seconds or hours to see any responce, that's normal on irc l885
2018-08-25 02:31:16	mike-zal	not sure what you want. browsers work like on windows so webapps work out of the box. because system is lighter, usually browsers also behave better
2018-08-25 02:31:19	l885	web apps is used is figma, zepling and some prototyping stuff
2018-08-25 02:31:48	precla	well, mike-zal it didn't work, gpu is still on ..
2018-08-25 02:31:50	l885	i just wondering does the web apps depend on GPU hardware acceleration?
2018-08-25 02:32:16	l885	because on last ubuntu 18.04 which i tried, the Hardware Accleration is not working
2018-08-25 02:32:37	l885	when playing HD video on YouTube it will get choppy
2018-08-25 02:32:46	mike-zal	I doubt that but I'm guessing. I never saw browsers to have gpu hardware acceleration settings
2018-08-25 02:32:54	mike-zal	so basically this is the same as on windows
2018-08-25 02:33:29	l885	@mike-zal, do you used to watch YouTube on your browser?
2018-08-25 02:33:34	mike-zal	l885: start a topic on manjaro forum. YT should be playing smoothly
2018-08-25 02:33:57	mike-zal	yes, YT works well for me, it always has, on various systems, even low end ones

2018-08-25 02:34:50	mike-zal	precla: the same advice. start a topic on forum. your problem should be easily managanle for users who are oriented in that kind of stuff
2018-08-25 02:35:19	l885	@mike-zal which DE did you used?
2018-08-25 02:35:20	mike-zal	l885: a question, how do you check YT on linux?
2018-08-25 02:35:30	mike-zal	is it installed system or virtualized?
2018-08-25 02:35:35	precla	ok, will see. i'm going to look if i find anything else before i post there
2018-08-25 02:35:41	precla	thanks tho mike-zal 
2018-08-25 02:35:44	mike-zal	if the latter, then you have a bottleneck
2018-08-25 02:36:27	mike-zal	virtualized systems use simple gpu drivers and don't allow for any hardware acceleration or fancy effects
2018-08-25 02:36:34	mike-zal	at least usually
2018-08-25 02:36:40	l885	@mike-zal installed ubuntu 18.04 before and it's buggy like hell. I managed to make it have a better performance after upgrading to latest unofficial kernel, but still most of web apps is not working as smooth as it in Windows. So after a couple days i give up and return back to Windows
2018-08-25 02:36:42	mike-zal	l885: I use Plasma
2018-08-25 02:37:48	mike-zal	did you try other DEs? Gnome tends to be heavy. Mate seems to be a better choice in general for ubuntu
2018-08-25 02:38:34	l885	@mike-zal tried KDE-Neon which based on Ubuntu, but some how this Debian based system have a limitation somehow
2018-08-25 02:38:48	l885	i was using Arch a couple years back
2018-08-25 02:38:57	l885	before Manjaro getting famous right now
2018-08-25 02:39:12	l885	but on that time i never do any "design" or using any web apps like now
2018-08-25 02:39:13	mike-zal	it's good to try different distros. my laptops usually didn't work well on ubuntus but are great on arch based systems
2018-08-25 02:39:23	mike-zal	but there are machines that behave differently
2018-08-25 02:40:36	mike-zal	anyway, this doesn't sound normal. browsers should work fine on linux. again, did you installed linux normally or virtualized?
2018-08-25 02:41:21	l885	Normally
2018-08-25 02:41:30	l885	never use any virtualized
2018-08-25 02:41:48	l885	do you any dedicated GPU on your machine?
2018-08-25 02:43:11	l885	 Intel(R) HD Graphics 620 is my Graphic Card, i'm using HP Laptop which also have some "Bang&Olfusen" Speaker and it also doesn't play well / loud enough when using Linux
2018-08-25 02:43:34	mike-zal	yes but desktop runs on intel since I have hybrid gpu

2018-08-25 05:29:48	beetlebau	Hello Everyone
2018-08-25 05:30:08	beetlebau	I've switched today from ElementaryOS to manjaro i3 17.1.11
2018-08-25 05:30:32	beetlebau	But after restarting (after finishing the installer) it enters the BIOS
2018-08-25 05:30:39	beetlebau	and no boot option is given
2018-08-25 05:31:03	beetlebau	I'm not very familiar with grub and efi and stuff but to me it looks like grub is not installed
2018-08-25 05:31:15	beetlebau	I've checked and there's a efi partition created
2018-08-25 05:31:57	beetlebau	But grub-install will fail with "cannot find efi partion" or something like that
2018-08-25 05:32:08	beetlebau	Any hints for me what to do?

2018-08-25 08:43:56	zava	[14:15:53] hey I'm having problems ocnnecting to a server via ssh. It says libtinfo needs a version information for screen and disconnects me
2018-08-25 08:43:56	zava	[14:16:25] I recently went pure fish from bash/fish and this is roughly related to that or me setting library path wrong
2018-08-25 08:43:56	zava	[14:16:44] my lib path is /usr/lib and /usr/lib32
2018-08-25 08:43:56	zava	[14:17:03] but sometimes it says /usr/lib/lib when I do env | grep LD_LIB

2018-08-25 08:43:56	***	Playback Complete.
2018-08-25 08:44:39	zava	yes
2018-08-25 08:44:50	zava	but either we are bad people and they hate us or it's not working out recently
2018-08-25 08:45:03	zava	I guess irc has its limitations
2018-08-25 08:45:21	Farshief	I'm getting some sort of error using unpackfs during installation
2018-08-25 08:45:37	zava	The manjaro forum is booming though I think go try that. I bet you get a useful response in no time
2018-08-25 08:45:38	Farshief	I read about some other people having the same error within the last 3 days online, so I'm not sure if it's some sort of installer issue
2018-08-25 08:45:53	zava	how are you installing it? standard usb?
2018-08-25 08:45:57	zava	do you have acpi activated?
2018-08-25 08:46:01	zava	in your bios  settings
2018-08-25 08:46:03	Farshief	booted live from usb yes
2018-08-25 08:46:19	Farshief	I'm not sure. I'll have to check
2018-08-25 08:46:23	zava	is there a certain feature you try to install
2018-08-25 08:46:35	zava	there is a commmand to check from within the live usb
2018-08-25 08:46:49	zava	you dont have to reboot I think
2018-08-25 08:46:55	Farshief	I'm doing a standard install, it fails right after choosing the erase this disk partition
2018-08-25 08:47:08	Farshief	I've tried manually setting partitions as well but it fails with the same error
2018-08-25 08:47:15	Farshief	Do you happen to know the command?
2018-08-25 08:47:21	zava	what if you open the terminal 
2018-08-25 08:47:24	zava	and use parted
2018-08-25 08:47:36	zava	or gparted if it is on the liveusb
2018-08-25 08:47:47	zava	try to set the partitions up manually if you know how to
2018-08-25 08:47:51	zava	it's not hard it's just another UI
2018-08-25 08:48:16	zava	then you can skip that step in installation just choose your partitions and you should be fine

2018-08-26 01:51:42	mchasard	yes but under 32 bits?
2018-08-26 01:51:49	Aph3x-WL	yes
2018-08-26 01:51:54	mchasard	which one ?

2018-08-26 01:56:00	mchasard	ok thanks i'm going to tae decision cause keeping a manjaro non updated its not really good
2018-08-26 01:56:49	mchasard	void is based on another distro or own os ?

It is as if it is using the internal intel GPU instead of th

2018-08-26 09:28:15	gogeta	lol
2018-08-26 09:28:28	uwjesq	mtn: Do you have any idea how to find out why it is using llvm?
2018-08-26 09:28:30	rydare	lol so i can't stay the night for cheap?
2018-08-26 09:28:38	mtn	uwjesq: wrong driver is the reason
2018-08-26 09:28:39	gogeta	lol
2018-08-26 09:28:47	mtn	uwjesq: or wrong config file
2018-08-26 09:29:26	rydare	well here's my desktop, i had to get the maintainers of icewm to patch the wm to achieve it https://u.teknik.io/piyWQ.png
2018-08-26 09:29:29	uwjesq	mtn: Let me just delete the config and let xorg do its autodetect thing.
2018-08-26 09:29:50	rydare	uwjesq: does nvidia-settings say no valid adapter or something/
2018-08-26 09:30:01	rydare	when you launch it from the command line
2018-08-26 09:30:03	mtn	uwjesq: you may have to reinstall the driver again after that, too
2018-08-26 09:30:13	gogeta	mtn, i help people who use diffrent realted distros all the time you see that all the time in ubuntu
2018-08-26 09:30:35	gogeta	mtn, its all the same to me
2018-08-26 09:30:43	uwjesq	rydare: Nvidia-Settings tells me all the details including temperature.
2018-08-26 09:31:02	rydare	usually it will throw an error if the driver isn't installed
2018-08-26 09:31:10	rydare	did you try removing 20-nvidia.conf yet
2018-08-26 09:31:16	gogeta	normaly a kernel error yea
2018-08-26 09:31:22	gogeta	if the driver was removed
2018-08-26 09:32:07	uwjesq	rydare: 20-nvidia.conf does not even exist.
2018-08-26 09:32:20	rydare	where are you checking?
2018-08-26 09:32:31	uwjesq	I will restart very quickly I'll stay logged in and will be able to read your messages.
2018-08-26 09:32:44	uwjesq	rydare: /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/
2018-08-26 09:32:48	rydare	it might be in mhwd.d
2018-08-26 09:33:01	rydare	that's the proper place for it i think

2018-08-26 09:54:58	uwjesq	rydare: I will paste them for this channel. Just a sec.
2018-08-26 09:55:00	rydare	can you open it and see what it says
2018-08-26 09:55:01	rydare	awesome
2018-08-26 09:57:44	uwjesq	rydare: They look very similar. Let me run a diff https://gist.github.com/hhirsch/504a2d7e6e59e84c8db439dcede29de5
2018-08-26 09:58:49	uwjesq	rydare: They are identical.
2018-08-26 09:58:50	rydare	are you able to boot to desktop
2018-08-26 09:58:55	uwjesq	rydare: Yes!
2018-08-26 09:58:57	rydare	ok
2018-08-26 09:59:10	rydare	you can delete both of those
2018-08-26 09:59:13	rydare	back them up if you want
2018-08-26 09:59:21	rydare	but they're just default nvidia-xconfig outputs
2018-08-26 09:59:28	rydare	what you want to do is open up nvidia-settings gui
2018-08-26 10:01:09	uwjesq	rydare: Deleted! What do I do in nvidia-settings?
2018-08-26 10:01:14	rydare	ok
2018-08-26 10:01:18	rydare	set up your screens how you like it
2018-08-26 10:01:39	rydare	i like to click on the advanced under X Server Display Configuration
2018-08-26 10:01:47	rydare	and enable ForceFullCompositionPipeline
2018-08-26 10:01:52	rydare	it helps me stop tearing
2018-08-26 10:01:57	rydare	but can be a performance drain
2018-08-26 10:02:16	uwjesq	Ok.
2018-08-26 10:02:29	rydare	then we're going to Save to X Configuration File
