2018-08-22 11:21:47	prg318	[10:10:26] d1rewolf: i have a _pass zsh completion file in /usr/share/zsh/site-functions ($fpath) and i get pass zsh completions.  you definitely don't need ohmyzsh or w/e
2018-08-22 11:21:47	d1rewolf	[10:11:16] prg318: what causes that _pass file to be loaded?
2018-08-22 11:21:47	prg318	[10:12:56] /usr/share/zsh/site-functions is in zsh's default $fpath
2018-08-22 11:21:47	prg318	[10:13:06] if you do echo $fpath in zsh you should see what your fpath is

2018-08-22 11:21:47	prg318	[10:13:45] stuff in fpath gets autoloaded
2018-08-22 11:21:47	d1rewolf	[10:15:43] prg318: I see. perhaps it's just a path issue. I'll investigate. thanks for the helpful guidance
2018-08-22 11:21:47	prg318	[10:16:30] glad i could help!  i would do something like "echo $fpath" in a zsh shell to see what your fpath is.  if you don't have defaults in your fpath, check your user's zsh config to see if you are overriding it in your user's config
2018-08-22 11:21:47	d1rewolf	[10:17:03] prg318: it looks like a path problem, so you were right ;)
2018-08-22 11:21:47	d1rewolf	[10:17:12] as someone who has used bash for years, then fish, and now zsh....is oh-my-zsh something folks recommend using or avoiding?
2018-08-22 11:21:47	prg318	[10:17:49] personally - i strongly discourage oh-my-zsh.. it often leads to situations wher eyou have tons of config files and you dont know how any of them work so when you have a problem you dont know what to do other than post in ohmyzsh boards and cross your fingers
2018-08-22 11:21:47	phy1729	[10:18:05] !omz
2018-08-22 11:21:47	machabot	[10:18:05] "omz" is shorthand for "oh-my-zsh", an extension which the consensus of this channel recommends against using.  If you see odd behaviour using omz, please try disabling omz and see if the issue remains. For assistance with oh-my-zsh, try the channel #oh-my-zsh.
2018-08-22 11:21:47	prg318	[10:18:21] ^^ yeah heh
2018-08-22 11:21:47	d1rewolf	[10:18:52] prg318: yeah, I figured as much. however, it'd be really nice to have a reasonable config to get started with which would not be too painful
2018-08-22 11:21:47	d1rewolf	[10:19:05] for me, it's more what I don't know zsh can do than what I do know
2018-08-22 11:21:47	phy1729	[10:19:08] There's a wizard to help with that
2018-08-22 11:21:47	prg318	[10:19:48] yeah i would highly recommend spending some time with the zsh config wizard to get a feel for what options you want
2018-08-22 11:21:47	d1rewolf	[10:20:13] ok, will do. thx guys
2018-08-22 11:21:47	psprint	[10:49:42] Ah, just used fast-syntax-highlighting with the ideal brackets-highlighting to find a bug that even Vim didn't disclose to me (a poorly visible unpaired brace)
2018-08-22 11:21:47	llua	[10:51:35] - shameless plug
2018-08-22 11:21:47	psprint	[10:54:28] - happy that something works
