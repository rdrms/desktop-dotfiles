2021-12-30 16:09:42	RJ45	does anyone here by chance happen to be using a 512GB WD BLACK PCIe Gen 4 M.2 SSD? right now?
2021-12-30 16:09:53	RJ45	specifically 512GB
2021-12-30 16:12:40	fart	That is tiny
2021-12-30 16:13:18	fart	I am curious what question you'd have where you needed to have that specific HD
2021-12-30 16:13:35	@Zanthas	i have the TB version of it
2021-12-30 16:13:36	TaZeR	my hard drive is 250gb atm :p

2021-12-30 16:14:26	TaZeR	the first name rings a bell
2021-12-30 16:14:31	TaZeR	mighta been him
2021-12-30 16:14:40	@Zanthas	yeah
2021-12-30 16:14:46	@Zanthas	he went by blackjoe
2021-12-30 16:14:47	TaZeR	but we became cool later on
2021-12-30 16:14:48	@Zanthas	as well
2021-12-30 16:14:56	@Zanthas	as well as centhalith or someshit
2021-12-30 16:14:56	RJ45	I am planning on selling it and replacing it with the 512GB version, as I have already raped most of its lifespan mining Chia
2021-12-30 16:15:17	@Zanthas	he was pissed you'd talk about drugs
2021-12-30 16:15:23	@Zanthas	i think your speeding habit
2021-12-30 16:15:25	RJ45	drugs are cool
2021-12-30 16:15:30	@Zanthas	iirc
2021-12-30 16:15:37	fart	dd old -> new, adjust partition size in fdisk, resize2fs
2021-12-30 16:15:46	@Zanthas	^
2021-12-30 16:15:58	@Zanthas	you can also use clonezilla
2021-12-30 16:16:10	RJ45	yeah I plan on using dd
2021-12-30 16:16:29	fart	Oh you're going from larger to smaller?
2021-12-30 16:16:29	RJ45	it'd just be nice to know the precise number of bytes beforehand
2021-12-30 16:16:43	RJ45	even though sure I can just resize after the fact
2021-12-30 16:16:57	fart	no dd in that case, I'd use a tool specifically for this because it'd have to reorganize to fit a smaller partition
2021-12-30 16:17:14	%rdr	maybe
2021-12-30 16:17:18	%rdr	someone's gonna save me
2021-12-30 16:17:21	%rdr	my heart is made is gravy
2021-12-30 16:17:28	RJ45	oh my partition is already less than half the space
2021-12-30 16:17:39	%rdr	partition service calls-calls-calls
2021-12-30 16:17:39	@Zanthas	use clonezilla for larger to smaller
2021-12-30 16:17:44	RJ45	but yes I am aware I would have-to resize it, in Gparted
2021-12-30 16:18:08	@Zanthas	i should get a matrix bridge in this bitch
2021-12-30 16:18:39	RJ45	it's amazing Gparted is free, it's always been an incredibly intuitive yet powerful tool
