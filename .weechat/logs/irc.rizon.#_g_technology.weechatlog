2018-08-25 07:52:14	THEWHITELION	although i do like the idea of having the package manager compile a program from its source before the program is installed

2018-08-25 08:06:53	THEWHITELION	do you really believe that something injects malicious code into your package builds?
2018-08-25 08:09:06	THEWHITELION	i admit that it is possible, but you can always download the source code directly, validate its hash, audit the code, then compile it, albeit that would be time consuming
2018-08-25 08:09:43	THEWHITELION	i have an idea, what if we formed a team of /g/men to audit open source code for malicious code?
2018-08-25 08:09:57	THEWHITELION	we could design and build our own package manager that checks for malicious code etc
2018-08-25 08:10:06	THEWHITELION	that would be a great project
2018-08-25 08:10:51	THEWHITELION	imagine a universal repository, compatible with most or all types of linux distributions
2018-08-25 08:11:43	THEWHITELION	all of the packages are audited for malicious code, the package manager validates the source before it's compiled, that would be nice

2018-08-25 19:21:35	prim	in terms of modern web browsers, are there other projects similar to waterfox or ungoogled chromium that a privacy concerned person should look at? this older laptop runs waterfox a bit slow... not sure about using regular chromium though
2018-08-25 19:22:10	rdr	chromium is going to be nearly as heavy as regular chrome
2018-08-25 19:22:31	rdr	there's alternatives to firefox and chrome/ium but they're lacking features
2018-08-25 19:22:39	rdr	sure you might get adblock but you won't get imagus
2018-08-25 19:22:44	rdr	if you're lucky you get usersripts
2018-08-25 19:23:25	orekix	qutebrowser and use hosts based adblocking, maybe
2018-08-25 19:23:28	prim	rdr: i find on this machine that chromium is noticably faster. 
2018-08-25 19:23:50	prim	oh i forgot about qutebrowser i'll give it a shot
2018-08-25 19:23:54	rdr	than chrome?  or waterfox
2018-08-25 19:23:57	rdr	also what os are you running
2018-08-25 19:24:53	prim	debian (devuan). chromium seems faster than waterfox.
2018-08-25 19:25:47	orekix	what waterfox version?
2018-08-25 19:26:47	rdr	prim, what toolkit are you primarily using?  gtk?
2018-08-25 19:27:41	rdr	it uses xfce by default but you can install kde
2018-08-25 19:31:06	prim	i believe version 56.2 64bit. yes gtk (xfce, i like xfce!). been using waterfox for a couple years and its great for me, with noscript, random agent spoofer, self-destructing cookies, ublock origin, disconnect, and my vpn.

2018-08-25 19:32:55		AntiMacro_Macro is now known as ozz
2018-08-25 19:33:16	prim	probably not a fair comparison with chromim however as i didn't have any adblock or anything running on chromium
2018-08-25 19:33:46	orekix	so it's still xul based, no surprise chromium is outperforming it
2018-08-25 19:34:17	prim	orekix: i don't know what xul is 
2018-08-25 19:34:25	rdr	how does a recent version of firefox work
2018-08-25 19:34:33	orekix	prim, mozilla's web rendering engine
2018-08-25 19:34:52	orekix	try a version based on quantum (58+)
2018-08-25 19:35:13	prim	oh i see. rdr i was under the impression that this is the most up-to-date version for *nix
2018-08-25 19:35:29	rdr	that might be the latest verison of waterfox
2018-08-25 19:35:34	rdr	i'm not sure if it's still updated
2018-08-25 19:35:45	rdr	devuan might not have firefox in the repositories
2018-08-25 19:35:51	rdr	might be iceweasel or whatever
2018-08-25 19:36:00	rdr	unless they have less strict stuff than debian
2018-08-25 19:36:13	prim	i believe it is the latest version of waterfox, i pulled it from the website not repos
2018-08-25 19:36:33	rdr	what makes you use waterfox?
2018-08-25 19:36:44	rdr	Firefox seems fine to me... is it the syncing stuff ?
2018-08-25 19:37:22	prim	mentioned in my original question its just privacy converns / philosophy
2018-08-25 19:37:43	prim	waterfox removes the wallet for instance
2018-08-25 19:37:57	rdr	so you can't save password?
2018-08-25 19:37:58	rdr	s
2018-08-25 19:38:12	prim	not sure what you're referring to
2018-08-25 19:38:41	rdr	like you go to a site, and your password/username is already filled because your browser saved it
2018-08-25 19:38:45	rdr	or is wallet a different feature
2018-08-25 19:38:54	orekix	I think he's talking about pocket?
2018-08-25 19:39:27	rdr	i'm on the waterfox site, and it includes a sync feature that lets you send tabs to waterfox on android
2018-08-25 19:39:48	rdr	seems like something that would turn off someone who was heavily concerned with privacy
2018-08-25 19:39:59	prim	yes pocket, sorry not wallet. yes i would refer to the website if you want to understand what the waterfox project is all about, rdr
2018-08-25 19:40:22	rdr	it's not a very helpful website
2018-08-25 19:40:30	rdr	says browse faster but it's using a slower rendering engine?
2018-08-25 19:42:59	prim	rdr: you are right, the waterfox website is a little bit light on meat
2018-08-25 19:43:24	prim	rdr: perhaps i bought into hype i heard about it being less cucked than firefox, for whatever reason
2018-08-25 19:43:40	rdr	yeah it's totally legitimate to not want to use chrome
2018-08-25 19:43:49	rdr	but i don't really know why firefox is a problem
2018-08-25 19:44:01	prim	something something blue haired sjw's
2018-08-25 19:44:04	prim	i don't know
2018-08-25 19:44:06	rdr	they're doing some cucked stuff with "women in tech" yeah
2018-08-25 19:44:14	rdr	but the actual browser seems fine
2018-08-25 19:44:21	rdr	i'd check out the gtk browsers
2018-08-25 19:44:25	rdr	you will miss out on features though
2018-08-25 19:44:33	rdr	but if you're not used to them it won't matter
2018-08-25 19:44:39	rdr	i can't live without imagus
2018-08-25 19:44:45	prim	i'm not much of a power user. i don't even know what imagus is
2018-08-25 19:44:55	orekix	firefox is still a saner and more privacy conscious choice than chrome, just disable pocket and opt out of telemetry
2018-08-25 19:45:07	rdr	basically any thumbnail, just hover over it, and it shows it in a frame
2018-08-25 19:45:17	prim	orekix: yes this option is something i may try here tonight
2018-08-25 19:45:46	prim	orekix: would you recommend ESR or the latest version
2018-08-25 19:46:00	orekix	latest
2018-08-25 19:46:24	rdr	NIGHTLY
2018-08-25 19:46:39	rdr	COMPILE WITH --funroll-loops
2018-08-25 19:47:06	rdr	does mozilla have a debian/devuan repository
2018-08-25 19:47:21	rdr	i just saw the most hilarious kerfuffle with the developer of xscreensaver vs debian
2018-08-25 19:47:34	prim	i believe the only package is firefox-esr from repos
2018-08-25 19:47:40	prim	not sure
2018-08-25 19:47:53	orekix	ah yes, jwz having an outbreak because debian packages old versions
2018-08-25 19:47:54	rdr	prim: they might take away the branding and call it iceweasel
2018-08-25 19:48:18	sebbu2	some extensions broke when "upgrading" from firefox 59.0.smth to firefox esr 52.0.9
2018-08-25 19:48:47	sebbu2	even though the later was released way after the former, and include his patches
2018-08-25 19:49:10	prim	ah yea there is 59.0-esr iceweasel from repos available also
2018-08-25 19:49:52	rdr	firefox 61 is available in unstable
2018-08-25 19:50:06	prim	cool
2018-08-25 19:51:27	sebbu2	ff 60+ doesn't support old extensions
2018-08-25 19:51:35	sebbu2	most extensions haven't been updated yet
2018-08-25 19:51:53	prim	sebbu2: thanks for the heads up, maybe i'll give that iceweasel a shot then
2018-08-25 19:52:05	orekix	most important have, the most important one that is missing is downthemall
