2021-02-11 07:14:31	@DataDrake|zzz	man, this PCB layout is amateur hour: https://github.com/system76/launch/blob/master/pcb/launch-pcb.png
2021-02-11 07:14:32	@NarwhalBot	[ launch/launch-pcb.png at master · system76/launch · GitHub ]
2021-02-11 07:15:14	sheepman[m]	what the heck?
2021-02-11 07:15:30	sheepman[m]	now, I've never done PCB design, but that does not look very tidy
2021-02-11 07:15:50	@DataDrake|zzz	yeah, I expected a lot better from system76
2021-02-11 07:15:50	sheepman[m]	minimizing trace length, I guess?
2021-02-11 07:16:09	@DataDrake|zzz	nah, this looks like auto-routing almost
2021-02-11 07:16:31	sheepman[m]	I suppose if it works it works
2021-02-11 07:16:45	@DataDrake|zzz	the USB traces don't even look to me matched impedance
2021-02-11 07:17:00	sheepman[m]	And at least they plated the screw holes and kept 12v planes away from them unlike /some/ people
2021-02-11 07:17:32	@DataDrake|zzz	the tolerances on those through-holes are pretty bad actually
2021-02-11 07:17:43	sheepman[m]	yeah
2021-02-11 07:17:50	sheepman[m]	but better than NZXT :D
2021-02-11 07:17:59	@DataDrake|zzz	the keepout they have is not as much as I'd give
2021-02-11 07:18:02	sheepman[m]	purely by way of having tolerances at all
2021-02-11 07:18:41	@DataDrake|zzz	that chip at the top is a USB hub
2021-02-11 07:19:20	@DataDrake|zzz	bottom left is an AVR micro for the keyboard controller
2021-02-11 07:20:02	@DataDrake|zzz	idk why they put it that far from the programming header and everything else
2021-02-11 07:21:33	sheepman[m]	honestly you might have a point about auto routing
2021-02-11 07:21:50	sheepman[m]	maybe it got stuffed there for "optimal" placement as far as getting lines to all the switches
2021-02-11 07:22:01	@DataDrake|zzz	well they still would have manually placed most of the components
2021-02-11 07:22:23	@DataDrake|zzz	I doubt they'd let the router move anything like that
2021-02-11 07:22:48	@DataDrake|zzz	more like they got tunnel vision
2021-02-11 07:24:04	sheepman[m]	maybe that too. with all the stuff at the top of the board spread out like it is, there's not a whole lot of room I can see for traces to run down to all the switches
2021-02-11 07:24:20	sheepman[m]	not to say that makes it make sense to put it all the way down in the bottom
2021-02-11 07:25:07	@DataDrake|zzz	plenty of room from what I'm seeing
2021-02-11 07:25:30	sheepman[m]	but you might have to use your brain to route things rather than just throwing it at the auto router :D
2021-02-11 07:25:54	sheepman[m]	I dunno though. as I said, I've got no real experience in this stuff at the moment
2021-02-11 07:26:17	@DataDrake|zzz	it does look like that corner is a keep-out area for the rear piece
2021-02-11 07:26:49	sheepman[m]	which, upper right?
2021-02-11 07:26:57	@DataDrake|zzz	upper left
2021-02-11 07:27:18	@DataDrake|zzz	if you look at the mechanical drawing https://github.com/system76/launch
2021-02-11 07:27:18	@NarwhalBot	[ GitHub - system76/launch: System76 Launch Configurable Keyboard ]
2021-02-11 07:27:39	@DataDrake|zzz	they have notches in the bottom plate for capacitors
2021-02-11 07:27:51	@DataDrake|zzz	so maybe it's just too tight
2021-02-11 07:27:51	sheepman[m]	huh yeah
2021-02-11 07:28:29	@DataDrake|zzz	then again, the switch sockets act a bit like stand-offs
2021-02-11 07:29:52	@DataDrake|zzz	idk
2021-02-11 07:30:01	@DataDrake|zzz	this whole design is bad, IMHO
2021-02-11 07:30:45	@DataDrake|zzz	keyboard hubs are dumb
2021-02-11 07:31:12	Doctor_Junglist	is there anything i can do in qbittorrent to make me seed the solus torrents harder? or is there not much to be done due to the torrents already being well-seeded?
2021-02-11 07:31:40	@DataDrake|zzz	mostly depends on demand from people downloading
2021-02-11 07:32:00	@DataDrake|zzz	most people will download directly rather than torrent to begin with
2021-02-11 07:34:00	TraceyC	Doctor_Junglist: The only thing you can do is to make sure it has no bandwidth limit. After that, you can only give out so much Halloween candy as you have takers

2021-02-11 08:38:09	Doctor_Junglist	bass needs distance to properly propagate, so you should move the sub further away from you

2021-02-12 02:33:00	@Girtablulu	someone isn't happy as well in which way Gnome is moving?
2021-02-12 02:34:28	Harvey	Took long enough.
2021-02-12 02:58:01	Scotty_Trees	According to the Gnome devs, they've spent years researching and this is what people want
2021-02-12 02:58:27	Scotty_Trees	as a gnome user, i don't think i ever agree with them
2021-02-12 02:59:11	Scotty_Trees	apparently, it'll fix a bunch of touchpad issues or gestures as well
2021-02-12 02:59:26	Scotty_Trees	but im a keyboard and mouse man, i touch my trackpad as a last resort
2021-02-12 02:59:33	@JoshStrobl	That must be one helluva skewed polling if they came to the conclusion GNOME 40 is what people wanted.
2021-02-12 02:59:39	Scotty_Trees	so all their 'changes' are infuritating to say the least
2021-02-12 03:00:17	Scotty_Trees	i don't know where the research is either. i don't know what kind of people their asking
2021-02-12 03:00:34	Scotty_Trees	"take our word for it"
2021-02-12 03:01:09	Scotty_Trees	gnome 40 will make a Budgie man out of me yet :P
2021-02-12 03:01:23	@JoshStrobl	yesssss, my master plan of letting GNOME destroy itself is working
2021-02-12 03:01:37	Scotty_Trees	^my thoughts exactly, actually
2021-02-12 03:02:04	Scotty_Trees	i wonder which gnome dev alias you go by to slowly corrupt them from the inside :P
2021-02-12 03:02:41	@JoshStrobl	I'd say "libhandy" but they have that taken already

2021-02-12 21:13:10	_shawn	oh ins tall. I was thinking in stall
2021-02-12 21:13:11	sheepman[m]	would be my guess, not being the one who wrote it
2021-02-12 21:14:59	sheepman[m]	yeah, I'd guess the rationale was that I and T are two different hands when touch typing, so it's slightly easier to type fast. Once you get used to it, it's not something that really makes a difference, and people who move from other distros and don't read all the docs can just keep typing "install" like they always had before :D
2021-02-12 21:15:12	sheepman[m]	or maybe it's just random, I don't know
2021-02-12 21:15:20	_shawn	you know if I set a .desktop (installed by a package) to hidden it will get overwritten on next install? hmm I wonder if one in my home directory will override the system one
2021-02-12 21:15:38	sheepman[m]	hmmm, I haven't tested that
2021-02-12 21:15:50	_shawn	er, not on next install, I mean on next update

2021-02-12 21:39:07	Harvey	removing the .desktop file will only work for awhile. It will be added back every update and eopkg will consider the package broken.

2021-02-12 21:39:36	_shawn	sheepman[m]: I realised I need to just comment out the entire .desktop in /usr/share because it also controls the mime types for file associations

2021-02-12 21:47:30	_shawn	I think it's moot though because freedesktop.org says this about NoDisplay:
2021-02-12 21:47:35	_shawn	NoDisplay means "this application exists, but don't display it in the menus". This can be useful to e.g. associate this application with MIME types, so that it gets launched from a file manager (or other apps), without having a menu entry for it (there are tons of good reasons for this, including e.g. the netscape -remote, or kfmclient openURL kind of stuff).
2021-02-12 21:47:52	_shawn	so even if I hide it I still need to deal with the mime types
2021-02-12 21:48:08	_shawn	well, if it worked yeah maybe I could override the mime types from the .local one too
2021-02-12 21:50:43	_shawn	thats weird, adding # to beginning of each line did not change how it was parsed
2021-02-12 21:50:54	_shawn	but renaming it to weechat.desktop.disabled worked
2021-02-12 21:52:52	_shawn	ok it wasnt parsing it until i renamed it
2021-02-12 21:54:37	_shawn	 mount -o 'relatime' prevents it from seeing change until the mv ?
2021-02-12 21:56:29	_shawn	mv forced the atime to be written I think
2021-02-12 21:56:54	sheepman[m]	yeah sounds about right
2021-02-12 21:57:02	_shawn	so yeah # comments work. now I have to wait for an update to see if I need chattr +i
2021-02-12 21:59:28	Harvey	Might not be what you're after but in case you don't know. krunner can be told to ignore applications entirely . I only have its "command line" setting enabled. So I get no predictions apart from krunner history predictions.
2021-02-12 21:59:52	Harvey	So you can still launch anything you want but yea... I find that less annoying.
2021-02-12 22:01:13	_shawn	ah yes good tip, there's an applications plugin
2021-02-12 22:03:05	_shawn	how do you launch interactive commands from krunner?
2021-02-12 22:03:30	_shawn	i tried pkill firefox, that runs so I know it's working
2021-02-12 22:05:53	Harvey	Ahh, yeah sorry. Never ran into that. I just use it to open a specific firefox profile. firefox -p Guest

2021-02-12 22:06:47	_shawn	yeah gui apps are running from krunner but not terminal ones like htop
2021-02-12 22:06:54	Harvey	Indeed.
2021-02-12 22:07:55	_shawn	konsole -e top
2021-02-12 22:09:54	Harvey	Yeah just found that myself :P
2021-02-12 22:11:35	_shawn	so it turns out in the DE there is a default terminal application, and "Terminal=true" in the .desktop tells it to open in the terminal. so thats why weechat has a .desktop it's to make krunner work
2021-02-12 22:12:19	_shawn	and similar tools of course
2021-02-12 22:17:56	_shawn	ok I guess I can ignore it for weechat. also I'm just going to learn how to use nano better I think
2021-02-12 22:18:30	_shawn	i just learned esc+a to select multiple lines and esc+3 to comment or uncomment them
2021-02-12 22:21:39	_shawn	woah esc and then U is undo... I did that because it's my habit from vim to exit insert mode and hit u
2021-02-12 22:21:45	TraceyC|roamin	That's a lot easier than in vim X|
2021-02-12 22:21:58	Harvey	micro is worth a spin if you like nano. shift + arrow to select multiple lines. ctrl + / to comment or uncomment

2021-02-12 22:22:25	TraceyC	That sounds ... logical
2021-02-12 22:22:37	sheepman[m]	babi is also fun, it's literally an exact clone of nano written in python
2021-02-12 22:22:47	sheepman[m]	so you can extend it with python scripts
2021-02-12 22:22:50	Harvey	An the type of comment is automatically changed depending on file type
2021-02-12 22:23:10	sheepman[m]	Harvey:  holy crap I may have to use that :D
2021-02-12 22:23:46	Harvey	Its neat.

2021-02-12 23:05:58	Harvey	samba would be an example of this.

2021-02-13 00:39:47	_shawn	might just need to switch to gnome lol

2021-02-13 00:41:09	Harvey	Gnome, like hard drugs is never the answer. :P
2021-02-13 00:46:21	_shawn	ok how about this, I make a wrapper for eopkg that checks the atime for gvim.desktop before and after it runs, and if it's differet it will printf "Hidden=true\n" >> gvim.desktop
2021-02-13 00:46:52	Harvey	I think not using vim or weechat or whatever the fuck might be easier :P
2021-02-13 00:47:30	_shawn	yeah thats what I am currently doing
2021-02-13 00:48:17	_shawn	that last idea was kinda a joke if you didnt know
2021-02-13 00:48:27	Harvey	I gathered :P
2021-02-13 00:48:49	Harvey	I mean, I'm rather tipsy atm but... not that bad.
2021-02-13 00:50:26	_shawn	what are in the delta updates? whole files?
2021-02-13 00:50:54	Harvey	ideally the difference between the installed package and the updated / rebuilt package.
2021-02-13 00:50:58	Harvey	But its not perfect.
2021-02-13 00:51:04	_shawn	bit by bit?
2021-02-13 00:51:59	Harvey	I don't pretend to understand exactly. I assume it is as complex as is individual file hash the same if not add to delta
2021-02-13 00:55:51	_shawn	I just opened up vim-100-101-1-x86_64.delta.eopkg and it actually had whole files in it, just the ones that were different from last time
2021-02-13 00:56:45	Harvey	Yeah
2021-02-13 00:57:16	Harvey	any change to the file would make the hash different so it would be added. But once again. Just my assumptions I don't actually know.

2021-02-14 11:24:44	Aph3x-WL	you don't like plasma because of the theme?
2021-02-14 11:24:50	Aph3x-WL	you know you can change that right?
2021-02-14 11:25:26	TraceyC	I mean, one of the main *advantages* of Linux DEs is how customizable they are
2021-02-14 11:28:13	abdulocracy	I couldn't find a decent material theme
2021-02-14 11:28:23	stalebread	>material theme
2021-02-14 11:28:24	stalebread	that's your issue
2021-02-14 11:28:47	TraceyC	material ... as in flat? I thought material was a description of a style of theme for Android
2021-02-14 11:29:33	TraceyC	(which I hate because they have less visually distinct bits but to each their own)
2021-02-14 11:33:18	Aph3x-WL	so plasma is bad because you couldn't find a good looking version of a shitty theme
2021-02-14 11:33:23	Aph3x-WL	doesn't make sense to me but ok
2021-02-14 11:33:28	 *	TraceyC snickers
2021-02-14 11:38:01	abdulocracy	Yep
2021-02-14 11:38:40	abdulocracy	I've been using a Material theme for a long time
2021-02-14 11:39:04	abdulocracy	I don't care if the DE's very customizable
2021-02-14 11:39:07	TraceyC	My only complaint with Plasma in regard to themes is that there are themes that don't have all the necessary assets. It's not pretty if you open your app menu and there are icons missing. I think some automated testing having to pass before a theme was allowed to be accepted would alleviate that
2021-02-14 11:39:09	abdulocracy	I want it to be familiar and work
2021-02-14 11:39:10	Aph3x-WL	having used something for a long is not a good reason to continue using it :P
2021-02-14 11:39:12	abdulocracy	For me
2021-02-14 11:39:18	Aph3x-WL	time*
2021-02-14 11:40:28	TraceyC	Out of curiosity, what was your preferred theme called?
2021-02-14 11:40:34	stalebread	Breeze
2021-02-14 11:40:45	abdulocracy	Plata at the moment
2021-02-14 11:40:55	abdulocracy	Was using Adapta, it's predecessor, before that
2021-02-14 11:41:05	abdulocracy	s/it's/its
2021-02-14 11:41:05	TraceyC	Adapta was really good looking
2021-02-14 11:41:14	stalebread	adapta-kde
2021-02-14 11:41:25	abdulocracy	It's shit
2021-02-14 11:41:29	TraceyC	Yeah, I see that in the global theme search
2021-02-14 11:41:30	stalebread	I know, it's adapta
2021-02-14 11:42:19	TraceyC	Materia KDE looks similar
2021-02-14 11:42:59	stalebread	I don't really find SolusDark Breeze to be so much different from Plata
2021-02-14 11:44:10	abdulocracy	I mean I haven't tried Plasma in a long while, perhaps I'll like it if I tried it now
2021-02-14 11:44:35	abdulocracy	s/I'll/I'd
2021-02-14 11:44:47	TraceyC	OK, so let me get this straight. There was some complaint about Plasma being shit because someone couldn't find a theme but hasn't used it in a long time?
2021-02-14 11:45:00	abdulocracy	That was me
2021-02-14 11:45:09	stalebread	"I tried Solus. Meh"
2021-02-14 11:45:17	TraceyC	If you hadn't used it in a long time how would you know it's currently great or shit?
2021-02-14 11:45:44	abdulocracy	I wasn't complaining, just a remark on the state when I used it in the past
2021-02-14 11:45:49	TraceyC	OK
2021-02-14 11:46:03	abdulocracy	"one reason I remember not liking Plasma was the theming"
2021-02-14 11:46:25	abdulocracy	Chill out fanbois
2021-02-14 11:46:25	stalebread	I tried Solus over a year ago and it had a 4.x series kernel so I can't really recommend it for modern hardware
2021-02-14 11:46:35	TraceyC	Who says I'm not chill?
2021-02-14 11:46:44	Aph3x-WL	plasma is your god
2021-02-14 11:46:45	abdulocracy	I do
2021-02-14 11:46:49	TraceyC	ha. OK
2021-02-14 11:47:32	abdulocracy	The main reason I can't use Plasma is too many knobs and dials
2021-02-14 11:48:20	abdulocracy	GNOME is dumb but it's simple and is the same practically everywhere
2021-02-14 11:48:27	Aph3x-WL	this wasn't meant to turn into an arguement, i just didn't know if he knew that he's not limited to the theme plasma ships with
2021-02-14 11:48:34	Aph3x-WL	some people seem to think they can't even change the wallpaper
2021-02-14 11:49:26	abdulocracy	I like connecting to remote machines or VMs and having the same GUI

2021-02-14 15:53:01	serebit	if a build fails, and you run it again and it fails the same way, it might be a cache error. if you run "sync; echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches" and then run the build again, and it succeeds, it was probably a cache error

2021-02-14 16:20:03	@DataDrake	most cases that would trigger the cache to mark the line as dirty and force a refetch on next access

2021-02-14 16:21:55	@DataDrake	if the checksum doesn't match the tracker then usually it'll either mark it as bad or redownload any mismatched blocks

2021-02-14 20:53:00	stalebread	why it's even a problem

2021-02-14 20:55:39	Aph3x-WL	i don't think that's a plasma issue because it doesn't do that on arch
2021-02-14 20:55:51	sheepman[m]	could be a solus plasma packaging issue
2021-02-14 20:56:04	stalebread	what's the strange part, the system settings did still show it's Breeze, then I reclicked on the dropdown to select Breeze again and it changed back to Breeze
2021-02-14 20:56:13	sheepman[m]	whaaat
2021-02-14 20:56:27	stalebread	I don't think it's an issue on my system because it has been doing it for a while across multiple reinstallations

2021-02-14 20:57:28	stalebread	_shawn: you definitely can edit mimetypes on Plasma
2021-02-14 20:57:39	sheepman[m]	oh my god it does that to me too _shawn
2021-02-14 20:57:44	_shawn	theres a gui for it but it would revert
2021-02-14 20:57:53	sheepman[m]	drives me up the wall
2021-02-14 20:58:34	sheepman[m]	if you have the time, it might be worth filing a bug report about the mimetype issue on the solus bugtracker
2021-02-14 20:58:50	stalebread	_shawn: I think the issue is it sources them from multiple places, and your changes got overridden by some other file
2021-02-14 20:58:53	_shawn	stalebread: it reverts after you edit because to edit them it saves a .desktop in ~/.local/share/applications and it ignores those
2021-02-14 20:59:11	_shawn	which i think is because it's not in some $XDG_ env var
2021-02-14 20:59:12	stalebread	umm no it doesn't?
2021-02-14 20:59:34	stalebread	I'm fairly sure I've made some overrides that way before

2021-02-14 21:02:31	stalebread	we need a Plasma-Bryan to tell us how things are
2021-02-14 21:04:12	Aph3x-WL	wouldn't a plasma-girt be better?
2021-02-14 21:04:40	stalebread	I haven't seen him doing rants/lectures about various technical stuff
2021-02-14 21:05:58	_shawn	ok but freedesktop.org says user installed locations of .desktops is supposed to be able override system installed ones, and that is not working on plasma
2021-02-14 21:06:29	_shawn	and I noticed when I tried to uethe mime editor it would work temporarily and then it would revert

2021-02-14 21:17:48	_shawn	and they all worked except for plasma
2021-02-14 21:18:45	stalebread	okay. might be they haven't implemented it or it doesn't work how it should

2021-02-14 21:22:13	_shawn	oh but vim also opens up in a terminal because it has a .desktop too
2021-02-14 21:22:25	_shawn	with all the same mime types
2021-02-14 21:23:49	_shawn	it uses Terminal=true which makes it open in the default terminal emulator

2021-02-15 04:39:28	@JoshStrobl	I've been primarily doing contract work while trying to gradually raise my Patreon and Liberapay so I can shift to doing full-time open source development. Been stuck dealing with some contract dev work for the last few months and hopefully getting to the end of it.

2021-02-15 04:55:01	@JoshStrobl	I mean if I get to the point where I'm able to work on open source full-time then I'm intent on having a Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday streaming schedule.

2021-02-15 05:01:00	@Girtablulu	so much streaming
2021-02-15 05:01:36	@JoshStrobl	Well so far I've been managing Tuesday / Thursday just fine. Trying to get as much work done as possible atm so I can hopefully free up a Friday as well.
2021-02-15 05:02:40	@Girtablulu	nice
2021-02-15 05:04:57	@JoshStrobl	I don't expect my time slot to be any different though. I know it means U.S. folks can't catch it most of the time, I just am really trying to stay committed to a normal sleeping schedule and streaming around U.S. times would also eat into the evening time I'd otherwise spend relaxing with the wife so.

2021-02-15 06:20:33	abdulocracy	The humongous titlebar is kind of annoying though
2021-02-15 06:21:16	abdulocracy	Oh and then they got the humongo titlebar in GNOME Terminal too
2021-02-15 06:22:03	@JoshStrobl	GtkHeaderbars are only 4 pixels larger than normal titlebars, I calculated it in Inkscape a while back
2021-02-15 06:22:26	abdulocracy	No they're huge ok
2021-02-15 06:22:27	abdulocracy	:p

2021-02-15 06:24:15	@JoshStrobl	I compared it using normal Plata
2021-02-15 06:24:45	@JoshStrobl	Plata-Compact makes normal titlebars too small IMO

2021-02-15 06:26:24	TraceyC	<# Tilix. On Plasma I'm using Konsole, it's got the same kind of tiling & such that Tilix has, these days

2021-02-15 06:26:55	abdulocracy	I find Plata non-compact to be jarring on 1080p
2021-02-15 06:27:08	@JoshStrobl	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2021-02-15 06:27:22	abdulocracy	Maybe I'm just a little picky
2021-02-15 06:27:41	TraceyC	Ooo someone has 3 monitors connected up. I'm jelly. My ultrawide DP monitor makes the KDE display settings lose its mind. I ort to try it out in Budgie
2021-02-15 06:27:48	@JoshStrobl	Personally I use tmux and zsh across all the things, so the terminal app for me rarely matters
2021-02-15 06:27:59	Eressea	imo plata is too dark, don't know how I'll do when it will be deprecated
2021-02-15 06:28:39	@JoshStrobl	By then I'll probably have my own GTK theme tbh
2021-02-15 06:28:44	Eressea	*when Adapta will be deprecated sorry
2021-02-15 06:29:05	@JoshStrobl	Yea I think the biggest complaint for Plata is the lack of contrast on some of the elements
2021-02-15 06:29:06	abdulocracy	Me too, tmux and zsh, so when I have a huge titlebar that serves no purpose it's kind of annoying

2021-02-15 06:39:22	abdulocracy	I wonder if it's still that bad, I heard they'd made some changes in the past few releases

2021-02-15 08:00:24	@JoshStrobl	I think GNOME does plenty of intelligent things, I just don't agree with basically any of their decisions around GNOME Shell, their push for Wayland in both GTK4 and Mutter that actively regress or eliminate X11 functionality but no reason, etc.
2021-02-15 08:01:15	@JoshStrobl	Like okay, you don't want to maintain the codebase for it, that's fine. Move it to an X11 namespace like the prior Gdk stuff and just fix FTBFS (fail to build from source) issues.
2021-02-15 08:01:28	abdulocracy	GNOME Wayland doesn't have a smooth mouse cursor
2021-02-15 08:01:39	abdulocracy	It's been a known issue for a while now

2021-02-15 08:02:07	abdulocracy	And Wayland is supposedly the production session
2021-02-15 08:02:28	@JoshStrobl	Frankly I'm tired of the dishonest marketing from both KDE and GNOME on the maturity of their Wayland compositors and Wayland sessions.
2021-02-15 08:02:55	TraceyC	Typical developer ego, no offense
2021-02-15 08:03:00	@JoshStrobl	None taken
2021-02-15 08:03:02	TraceyC	Plus a splash of marketing
2021-02-15 08:03:47	sheepman[m]	Wayland won't be usable until it has color calibration support.
2021-02-15 08:04:12	livingsil94|work	+1 sheepman[m]. That's essential in some environment
2021-02-15 08:04:35	TraceyC	If you're doing video / graphics production, for instance, absolutely
2021-02-15 08:06:30	sheepman[m]	I'm just a hobbyist photographer, and not having the option to calibrate colors would drive me insane
2021-02-15 08:15:08	TraceyC	yeah

2021-02-15 08:25:57	@Girtablulu	bhahahaha
2021-02-15 08:26:00	@Girtablulu	shit xD
2021-02-15 08:26:20	@Girtablulu	well he should work and not hang out in here :>
2021-02-15 08:26:43	@JoshStrobl	You may still want to PM him :P
2021-02-15 08:26:53	@Girtablulu	yea
2021-02-15 08:27:25	TraceyC	You clicked it wrong. Clearly
2021-02-15 08:28:21	@JoshStrobl	You know how this could be avoided? Using normal IRC commands or a terminal-based IRC client :P
2021-02-15 08:28:53	@JoshStrobl	/query ftw
2021-02-15 08:29:00	@Girtablulu	well probably moved my cursor a bit, right click is menu and than left click to choose and kick comes next after PM
2021-02-15 08:29:58	@JoshStrobl	You'd think it'd at least prompt you :D
2021-02-15 08:30:23	@Girtablulu	nope gonna stick to thelounge
