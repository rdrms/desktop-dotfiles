2018-08-25 12:01:52	Emil	rydare: no, we only help with awk
2018-08-25 12:02:02	rydare	ok well maybe awk could work for this
2018-08-25 12:02:11	rydare	i have a string from my weather script
2018-08-25 12:02:11	Emil	I meant ed
2018-08-25 12:02:30	rydare	Current weather is Partly Cloudy in Medicine Hat in Alberta for August 25 at 12:02pm MDT
2018-08-25 12:02:43	rydare	i'm trying to isolate the weather condition
2018-08-25 12:02:55	rydare	 sed 's/Current\ weather\ is //g' removes the part before the weather condititon

2018-08-25 12:05:39	Emil	rydare: you sure you can't just get the weather through some sane api
2018-08-25 12:07:38	Emil	you can also do it with a single sed command:
2018-08-25 12:08:07	rydare	maybe a single command is beter
2018-08-25 12:08:12	Emil	# echo 'Current weather is Partly Cloudy in Medicine Hat in Alberta for August 25 at 12:02pm MDT' | sed 's/Current weather is //; sed s/ in .*//'

2018-08-25 12:09:10	rydare	thanks for your help

2018-08-25 12:10:48	rydare	awesome

2018-08-25 12:10:53	shbot	Emil: no output
2018-08-25 12:11:00	Emil	yeah you need the -E for the .*
2018-08-25 12:11:09	rydare	that must have been my issue
2018-08-25 12:11:10	Emil	you can substitute that with .{1,} iirc
2018-08-25 12:11:29	Emil	well, {0,} tha tis

2018-08-25 12:13:15	Emil	ohwell, not worth flooding more
2018-08-25 12:13:21	Emil	rydare: hope you got what you were after
2018-08-25 12:13:25	rydare	is there a way to strip the colours it comes with?  currently shows up as [weirdcharacter][36mPartly Cloudy[weird character][0m
2018-08-25 12:13:32	rydare	maybe i can do that with the script
2018-08-25 12:13:38	Emil	wait
2018-08-25 12:13:46	Emil	are you trying to parse the command line weather thingy
2018-08-25 12:13:56	Emil	wttr.in
2018-08-25 12:13:59	rydare	yes
2018-08-25 12:14:05	Emil	psl
2018-08-25 12:14:27	Emil	you can iirc get just the parts you want
2018-08-25 12:15:05	Emil	http://wttr.in/:help
2018-08-25 12:17:05	Emil	rydare: with the ?T
2018-08-25 12:17:26	Emil	rydare: it's often worth it to read the docs
2018-08-25 12:17:32	rydare	oh i'm using a different script
2018-08-25 12:17:43	Emil	you said yes to wttr.in :D
2018-08-25 12:17:44	rydare	it doesn't come with a man page and only limited --help
2018-08-25 12:17:56	rydare	yes to command line thingey
2018-08-25 12:17:59	Emil	ah
2018-08-25 12:18:00	Emil	okay
2018-08-25 12:18:01	rydare	but not that one
2018-08-25 12:18:01	Emil	well
2018-08-25 12:18:14	rydare	i could try using this one... do you know how to give the arguments?
2018-08-25 12:18:28	Emil	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17998978/removing-colors-from-output
2018-08-25 12:18:30	rydare	curl wttr.in/?T says no matches found
2018-08-25 12:18:31	Emil	You can try that
2018-08-25 12:19:03	Emil	rydare: you of course need curl for curl to work
2018-08-25 12:19:20	rydare	yeah the default url works
2018-08-25 12:19:22	rydare	maybe i have to put http
2018-08-25 12:19:38	rydare	ah yes that's it
2018-08-25 12:20:57	rydare	i think this one is harder to parse
2018-08-25 12:21:12	rydare	i'll just try stripping the colours
2018-08-25 12:21:54	rydare	thanks for all your help Emil
