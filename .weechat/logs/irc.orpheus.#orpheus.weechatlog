2021-12-07 03:15:39	krok	nice
2021-12-07 03:17:04	+helifreak	still a better use of bits than country

2021-12-07 05:28:26	zxcvb2	it was on there for over 3 years
2021-12-07 05:28:40	+helifreak	that explains why i recall seeding it but aren't currently
2021-12-07 05:30:12	zxcvb2	i wonder how much data you'd have to redownload to get on the new torrent, assuming they just changed the tags on the same exact mp3s

2021-12-07 05:30:42	zxcvb2	so basically nothing i think

2021-12-07 16:59:36	sharky	or is that just attempting to parse a json 
2021-12-07 17:01:27	sharky	https://i.imgur.com/VYfgnyJ.png when trying to import "Nekuraroido no Tsukurikata (ネクラロイドのつくりかた) " but its only the title field thats fucked. has been happening for like 2-3 months? I might start using redcurry if it doesnt have the same issue 
2021-12-07 17:07:28	CaptainK	You cant beat a Jalfreezi
2021-12-07 17:10:35	infinitycircuit	sharky: what are you using now? i've never had a problem with non-latin alphabets with transplant
2021-12-07 17:11:08	ilikepeaches	sharky i'm pretty sure redcurry handles non-latin characters both because i've never had an issue and because i know we worked to make it play nice with JPS, i think it was?
2021-12-07 17:11:25	ilikepeaches	so we surely would've encountered issues
2021-12-07 17:11:58	sharky	infinitycircuit, the native JSON parser on ops upload form seems to fuck up the encoding on only the title box 
2021-12-07 17:12:12	sharky	all im doing is extracting a json from red or other gazelle site and sticking it in there
2021-12-07 17:12:12	ilikepeaches	IIRC some of OPS's recent changes or issues have impacted its ability to do OPS → RED transfers, but that's such a rare use case for me that we haven't circled back to work on it
2021-12-07 17:12:24	sharky	the OPS to RED transfers dont work because the genre field is fucked now
2021-12-07 17:12:28	infinitycircuit	sorry, by "transplant" i am referring to mahkitah's tool of that name, not the geenral procedure
2021-12-07 17:12:58	CaptainK	Blimey old school tools
2021-12-07 17:13:26	sharky	infinitycircuit, https://orpheus.network/forums.php?action=viewthread&threadid=683 i just use this

2021-12-07 17:13:29	ilikepeaches	sharky O RLY?  i literally have not investigated at all
2021-12-07 17:13:51	ilikepeaches	do we need to re-map them like with the release type lists, or is it just that OPS is messed up
2021-12-07 17:13:56	sharky	the genre field returns nothing, its just empty. or with some tools its numbers (probably the ID of the genre instead of the genre)
2021-12-07 17:14:04	ilikepeaches	yeah i think we get numbers
2021-12-07 17:14:09	sharky	and because theres no genres it wont upload the torrent 
2021-12-07 17:14:14	sharky	cause red requires at least one afaik
2021-12-07 17:14:14	ilikepeaches	got it
2021-12-07 17:14:30	infinitycircuit	hm, i last did an ops->red 3 days ago and it seemed to work fine https://redacted.ch/torrents.php?id=1659826&torrentid=3506208
2021-12-07 17:14:42	ilikepeaches	thanks i will relay here & there
2021-12-07 17:15:21	sharky	but in any case, the native json parser thingy on orpheus' upload form seems to be incorrectly parsing the title field 
2021-12-07 17:15:31	sharky	was just curious if redcurry had the same problem but since it doesnt thats good to hear
2021-12-07 17:15:49	sharky	will probably switch to that if my brain is big enough to install ruby 
2021-12-07 17:18:03	mahkitah	The genre tags  in the json were a dict for a while but that has been restored to a list a couple of days ago

2021-12-07 17:25:06	ilikepeaches	sharky you're getting the json from RED using an OPS userscript, though, right?
2021-12-07 17:25:08	ilikepeaches	if i remember right
2021-12-07 17:25:17	sharky	it's a NWCD userscript tbh
2021-12-07 17:25:18	ilikepeaches	so actually that script is the thing that probably needs attention
2021-12-07 17:25:25	ilikepeaches	ah well they ded
2021-12-07 17:25:36	sharky	it's not the script thats the problem
2021-12-07 17:25:44	sharky	as both the red and ops json contains the same info for the title

2021-12-07 17:27:22	mahkitah	Don't titles from the RED json need to be html unescaped
2021-12-07 17:29:46	sharky	I have no idea friend
2021-12-07 17:30:33	mahkitah	yes it does, I just checked the transplant code
2021-12-07 17:31:33	ilikepeaches	sharky i would use a tool (like transplant or redcurry) that's being updated etc.  the old json userscript thing is getting longer & longer in the teeth
2021-12-07 17:32:10	mahkitah	It's a lot less work too
2021-12-07 17:32:42	sharky	It's more work if you dont wanna type >:(

2021-12-08 00:50:00	CharCookie	hey dumb question maybe, but when i uploaded before, the albums show up on the homepage right away, but now it's not. did i do something wrong?
2021-12-08 00:50:19	CharCookie	rutorrent has been weird recently to be fair
2021-12-08 00:51:56	ilikepeaches	CharCookie the homepage and torrents.php reflect site uploads only i.e. won't be impacted by whether or not you've seeded
2021-12-08 00:52:15	ilikepeaches	and so r(u)torrent issues won't affect whether your uploads show up there
2021-12-08 00:52:41	CharCookie	I see
2021-12-08 00:52:46	ilikepeaches	more likely there are caching issues, or your uploads don't have group artwork, or you happened to upload at the same time as a bunch of other uploads, etc.
2021-12-08 00:52:49	ilikepeaches	if they show up on https://orpheus.network/torrents.php
2021-12-08 00:52:53	ilikepeaches	then you're good
2021-12-08 00:53:07	ilikepeaches	but even pages like that can sometimes be cached etc. so may not be 100% current; i don't know
2021-12-08 00:53:13	CharCookie	I'm adding a missing format to someone else's uploaded album, would that be the reason?
2021-12-08 00:53:37	ilikepeaches	there is probably an announce channel here on orpheus IRC where you can see things announced in real-time as they're uploaded
2021-12-08 00:53:45	ilikepeaches	that's how autosnatchers grab torrents
2021-12-08 00:54:05	CharCookie	ah yes, i'll check that
2021-12-08 00:54:18	ilikepeaches	but i've never done that on this network so actually don't know off the top of my head what the channel is called
2021-12-08 00:54:35	ilikepeaches	as for additional formats impacting whether things show up there, i'm not sure
2021-12-08 00:54:57	ilikepeaches	the things i see there now are definitely uploads to groups that already existed
2021-12-08 00:55:28	CharCookie	i'm dumb, i already uploaded a few minutes ago, entering #announce now wouldn't really help lol
2021-12-08 00:55:37	ilikepeaches	you can also do a log search
2021-12-08 00:55:38	ilikepeaches	https://orpheus.network/log.php?search=charcookie
2021-12-08 00:55:47	ilikepeaches	altho again log stuff is sometimes cached
2021-12-08 00:55:51	CharCookie	oh nice it's there
2021-12-08 00:55:59	CharCookie	in the sitelog
2021-12-08 00:56:42	CharCookie	I'm just a bit sad nobody will download it cuz it's not showing up on recent uploads :(
2021-12-08 00:56:58	ilikepeaches	well, that doesn't follow
2021-12-08 00:57:06	CharCookie	Thanks for the help peaches 
2021-12-08 00:57:17	ilikepeaches	autosnatchers download things as they're announced.  if you permaseed, you may get a download down the line
2021-12-08 00:57:30	ilikepeaches	and on OPS you get BPs for uploading and seeding, so even a zero-snatches upload is good for you
2021-12-08 00:57:54	ilikepeaches	CharCookie no problem thanks for uploading
2021-12-08 00:58:07	CharCookie	:)

2021-12-08 18:00:22	qbitbuddy	Hello
2021-12-08 18:00:25	qbitbuddy	I have a quick question
2021-12-08 18:00:37	qbitbuddy	What does the "Scene" tag mean?
2021-12-08 18:00:50	qbitbuddy	I notice its next to an album with the tags "FLAC/Lossless/Scene"
2021-12-08 18:01:22	NealRame	hey qbitbuddy. It means that the upload was sourced from a release that was made by a scene group somewhere else
2021-12-08 18:01:53	NealRame	for example with movies, ...-YIFY . In that case the scene group would be YIFY

2021-12-10 17:08:29	itismadness	[23:15:47] I feel like twitter threads were just people did not want to run a blog, they only occasionally did long threads.

2021-12-27 07:53:14	SabotageHeave3	[10:43:30] this is out there, but I don't suppose anyone has any invitations to MaM handy? Interviews are c losed until the 8th
2021-12-27 07:53:14	mahkitah	[11:38:46] Asking for invites is a big no no. See chat rules
2021-12-27 07:53:14	SabotageHeave3	[12:34:56] uhoh, I'm getting a lot of "invalid torrent" errors when I try importing torrents from orpheus. It's not universal, is that just a sign of a (lot) of bad torrents, or something else? Some googling suggests it might be orpheus side?
2021-12-27 07:53:14	SabotageHeave3	[12:35:15] when I check the logs It looks like "MonoTorrent.TorrentException: Invalid torrent file specified

2021-12-27 07:53:14	SabotageHeave3	[12:35:41] mahkitah ah thanks for that... sorry 
2021-12-27 07:53:14	sharky	[12:38:23] surprised that didn't auto kick you for spam 
2021-12-27 07:53:14	SabotageHeave3	[12:40:16] yeah I'm really sorry about that still learning the syntax of irc
2021-12-27 07:53:14	SabotageHeave3	[12:40:27] would it have been better as a screenshot?
2021-12-27 07:53:14	SabotageHeave3	[12:40:51] (I also tried to join the help channel but hermes said I couldn't...)
2021-12-27 07:53:14	sharky	[12:40:53] usually users would put that in a pastebin , 
2021-12-27 07:53:14	sharky	[12:41:11] Like 0bin (https://0bin.net/) or literal pastebin or one they prefer
2021-12-27 07:53:14	SabotageHeave3	[12:41:46] 0bin looks awesome thanks
2021-12-27 07:53:14	SabotageHeave3	[12:41:48] will do
2021-12-27 07:53:14	sharky	[12:41:58] why can't you join
2021-12-27 07:53:14	sharky	[12:42:01] what did hermes output
2021-12-27 07:53:14	SabotageHeave3	[12:42:31] "hermes> I'm sorry, you lack the right permissions to join #help"
2021-12-27 07:53:14	sharky	[12:43:13] hm
2021-12-27 07:53:14	sharky	[12:44:20] you can try joining the channel using hermes instead of the /join command, /msg hermes enter #help SabotageHeave3 YourIRCKey 
2021-12-27 07:53:14	SabotageHeave3	[12:44:32] yep that's what I did
2021-12-27 07:53:14	sharky	[12:44:43] and it also doesnt work if you just type /join #help ?
2021-12-27 07:53:14	SabotageHeave3	[12:45:03] 🤦that'll do it

2021-12-28 04:25:53	Grohl	So, UTM was incorrectly representing stats due to some 24b vinyl rips in the same edition being counted as unique, rather than one per edition.
2021-12-28 04:26:08	Grohl	So I get demoted and it was fixed, I should regain it "properly" this time around
2021-12-28 04:42:35	NeutraL	thats nice :)
2021-12-28 04:42:41	NeutraL	great work buddy!
2021-12-28 04:43:35	NeutraL	Ive been working hard too to get some uploads, I have collected almost 300 old CDs from various places im gonna go trough em soon and start uploading. I know it aint much but its somethign!
2021-12-28 04:44:03	NeutraL	still waiting for the external drive and that much needed time for ripping it all
2021-12-28 04:44:18	NeutraL	damn wife and kids taking all my time :D
2021-12-28 04:47:01	sharky	you know 300 physical cds isn't much? bruh
2021-12-28 04:47:19	sharky	physically ripping a single CD puts you in the 1% of uploaders lol
2021-12-28 04:47:19	NeutraL	hmm
2021-12-28 04:47:30	NeutraL	well doesnt feel that much :D
2021-12-28 04:47:41	NeutraL	good to hear its sumtin
2021-12-28 04:47:56	sharky	It's an insane amount, and i'm sure lots of people will appreciate your efforts
2021-12-28 04:48:00	NeutraL	but some of them are already on the site tho
2021-12-28 04:48:04	NeutraL	but I will get some
2021-12-28 04:48:11	sharky	on the site w/ 100% log w/ checksum + cue?
2021-12-28 04:48:20	NeutraL	not sure about that
2021-12-28 04:48:29	sharky	cause I mean, you can still trump existing torrents assuming they are trumpable
2021-12-28 04:48:30	NeutraL	havent checked it to extend
2021-12-28 04:49:00	NeutraL	The time is so limited I need to wait for the wife and kids go on grandparents for the weekend or something like that so I can get to work
2021-12-28 04:49:18	commoner	300 CDs, 45 minutes per rip, 16 hours of ripping a day = 2 weeks of doing nothing but ripping and sleeping
2021-12-28 04:49:32	sharky	Also, may as well make a pile of CDs that are already on site and untrumpable, then stick them in eac one by one starting a rip then aborting to get the TOC, maybe your TOC will be different than existing copy and youd be able to upload as a unique edition
2021-12-28 04:49:40	sharky	>45 mins
2021-12-28 04:49:43	sharky	lol my rips take 2 hours :-(
2021-12-28 04:50:21	NeutraL	thanks for all those tips and information I havent been able to do much of the research and reading it up
2021-12-28 04:50:40	commoner	I just about hit 2x, but with test+copy that's just 1x

2021-12-30 13:30:47	ToHellWithGA	[20:00:13] rtorrent doesn't crash
2021-12-30 13:30:47	Anakata	[20:14:57] its the terrible settings that crash the client
2021-12-30 13:30:47	commoner	[20:15:15] damn users, they ruined software
2021-12-30 13:30:47	Anakata	[20:15:34] many have 10k+ running fine on just one instance
2021-12-30 13:30:47	Anakata	[20:15:50] whereas others cant get beyong a few 100
2021-12-30 13:30:47	Anakata	[20:15:56] beyond
2021-12-30 13:30:47	Anakata	[20:16:16] so true commoner, so true
2021-12-30 13:30:47	Anakata	[20:17:03] software was way better when written by engineers for engineers
2021-12-30 13:30:47	seditious	[20:28:09] yes i must be clicking Add Torrent the wrong way
2021-12-30 13:30:47	ToHellWithGA	[20:28:25] clicking?
2021-12-30 13:30:47	ToHellWithGA	[20:28:39] rtorrent is cli/ncurses
2021-12-30 13:30:47	ToHellWithGA	[20:28:49] maybe your wrapper is busted
2021-12-30 13:30:47	seditious	[20:28:49] rtorrent crashed. rutorrent is my frontend.
2021-12-30 13:30:47	seditious	[20:29:01] so i was adding through that
2021-12-30 13:30:47	ToHellWithGA	[20:29:10] i blame rutorrent for crashing rtorrent, but mostly i blame you
2021-12-30 13:30:47	seditious	[20:29:16] ok
2021-12-30 13:30:47	ToHellWithGA	[20:29:18] none of this would have happend if you were never born
2021-12-30 13:30:47	ToHellWithGA	[20:29:22] but i'm glad you're her
2021-12-30 13:30:47	seditious	[20:29:33] i think im gonna take a break. 
2021-12-30 13:30:47	ToHellWithGA	[20:29:55] good luck
2021-12-30 13:30:47	ToHellWithGA	[20:30:17] my .rtorrent.rc is 10 lines
2021-12-30 13:30:47	ToHellWithGA	[20:30:42] i should get it up to around 13 to segregate music trackers, video trackers, and everything else

2021-12-30 13:39:49	Anakata	use watch folders and add new torrents like that
2021-12-30 13:40:15	Anakata	and re rutorrent, first thing you need to do is increase php mem limit
2021-12-30 13:41:06	Anakata	just use it to view, organize, or whatever

2021-12-30 22:06:45	ch0de	it's an easy listening song, from the 70's I think, but could be 60's or 80's
2021-12-30 22:07:03	ch0de	the lyric I remember is "my heart bangs like a drum, like a drum"
2021-12-30 22:07:23	ch0de	any ideas?, 'cos everything I search leads to nowhere

2021-12-30 22:08:36	ch0de	it had like, a kickdrum, and an acoustic guitar
2021-12-30 22:08:51	ch0de	played throughout

2021-12-30 22:14:33	ch0de	male vocals
2021-12-30 22:14:53	ch0de	melodic guitar throughout, easy listening style of drum beat

2021-12-30 22:19:30	ilikepeaches	"rovianne"
2021-12-30 22:19:59	ch0de	what I'm looking for it like the same genre of music as simon and garfield, fleetwood mac, the beutiful south
2021-12-30 22:20:09	ch0de	that kinda sound
2021-12-30 22:21:40	ilikepeaches	well, rick springfield fits that
2021-12-30 22:21:57	ilikepeaches	but is early 80s mostly i think
2021-12-30 22:22:55	ilikepeaches	lol "she bangs" by william hung
2021-12-30 22:23:23	ch0de	I can't find rovianne by rick springfield

2021-12-30 22:24:02	ilikepeaches	the exact wording of the lyric you do remember is really important
2021-12-30 22:24:07	ilikepeaches	b/c beats vs. bangs
2021-12-30 22:24:18	ilikepeaches	the metaphor of heart vs. drum is ... really common
2021-12-30 22:25:20	ch0de	the lyrics call for 'like a drum, like a drum', said twice
2021-12-30 22:25:37	ch0de	not sure it's it's beats like a drum or bangs like a drum

2021-12-30 22:27:21	ch0de	it was all acoustic
2021-12-30 22:27:32	ch0de	a soft acoustic guitar melody throughout
2021-12-30 22:27:45	ch0de	with a drum behind it
2021-12-30 22:28:03	ilikepeaches	"i'm pretty sure it had the word 'the' in it and some guitar"

2021-12-31 00:38:33	NealRame	could be, yes
2021-12-31 00:38:38	mcfries	or delete it
2021-12-31 00:38:46	mcfries	either way it helps the site
2021-12-31 00:39:10	NealRame	look, here's an existing torrent with the same tracks https://orpheus.network/torrents.php?id=803624&torrentid=1750400 . That one has much betters specs, almost all the way up to 22 KHz and is already lossy master-approved

2021-12-31 00:41:58	mcfries	press the button then NealRame 
2021-12-31 00:42:04	mcfries	do your OPS civic duty

2021-12-31 00:55:25	NealRame	commoner, I'd appreciate your input on this as well

2021-12-31 00:58:14	ilikepeaches	none of this is lossy
2021-12-31 00:58:19	ilikepeaches	why is this lossy master approved?
2021-12-31 00:59:54	commoner	I'm no spectrum analyzer, NealRame
2021-12-31 01:00:13	ilikepeaches	the existing torrent is not lossy and should not be lossy master approved
2021-12-31 01:00:58	ilikepeaches	the new specs are likely not "lossy" either but do have more of a low-pass filter.  qobuz probably downsamples from 24bit different than deezer does or something similar

2021-12-31 01:06:57	NealRame	ilikepeaches: thanks. and you think that it's likely not lossy because the upper end of the spectrum (20 KHz) isn't completely black, but backgrounded my a bit of 'mist' 
2021-12-31 01:07:24	NealRame	and these peaks aren't compression artifacts you reckon?
2021-12-31 01:08:00	ilikepeaches	grabbing these from the sources and looking at specs + zooms ... nothing here is "lossy" as i generally report it
2021-12-31 01:08:16	ilikepeaches	what we're looking for is lossy blocks, and they're not there
2021-12-31 01:08:24	ilikepeaches	there's a low pass filter that ends at 20.5kHz
2021-12-31 01:08:39	ilikepeaches	which is hmm but not abnormal

2021-12-31 01:09:53	ilikepeaches	i don't know how in the world they get lossy master approved
2021-12-31 01:10:06	ilikepeaches	the new one, that's how they look coming straight from qobuz, i can confirm
2021-12-31 01:10:17	ilikepeaches	not lossy though

2021-12-31 01:11:25	ilikepeaches	neither is consistently better than the other in this regard.

2021-12-31 01:13:10	ilikepeaches	did your dog bark this insight to you
2021-12-31 01:13:21	NealRame	heheh
2021-12-31 01:14:53	NealRame	my doubt about the newer upload mainly stems from this: "MP3 320kbps (CBR) has a frequency cut-off at 20.5 kHz." . Taken from nowhere other than https://interview.orpheus.network/spectral-analysis.php
2021-12-31 01:15:17	NealRame	but it's not a total cutoff, there's a teeny tiny but of stuff happening all the way

2021-12-31 01:15:39	ilikepeaches	cut-off by itself is not dispositive

2021-12-31 01:16:07	ilikepeaches	gotta?
2021-12-31 01:16:12	commoner	'is'
2021-12-31 01:16:31	NealRame	indeed, those mysterious lossy blocks seem to hold the keys to spec-analysis mastery
2021-12-31 01:16:34	ilikepeaches	to be or not to be, that the question
2021-12-31 01:16:47	NealRame	but I have a guess on what they mean already. We're talking horizontal blocks, probably?
2021-12-31 01:16:57	NealRame	the grains? the 576 sample thingo?
2021-12-31 01:17:58	NealRame	anyway, I don't mean to overextend this. Thanks for your input guys
2021-12-31 01:19:02	NealRame	but definitely wouldn't hate u if you tell me what they are, how to ID them etc, ilikepeaches. I'm genuinely curious.
2021-12-31 01:20:02	ilikepeaches	i'm trying to find a perfect example
2021-12-31 01:22:00	ilikepeaches	here's a super lossy intro track zoom https://ptpimg.me/e5c199.png
2021-12-31 01:22:10	ilikepeaches	see the ragged pattern, that is serious lossy decay
2021-12-31 01:22:18	ilikepeaches	the cut-off tells us we should probably look at the zoom
2021-12-31 01:22:29	ilikepeaches	the zoom shows us this uneven pattern of data being discarded
2021-12-31 01:22:54	ilikepeaches	here is a lossy sample combined with additional lossless audio https://ptpimg.me/511hsl.png
2021-12-31 01:23:05	ilikepeaches	those rice-like blobs are quintessential "lossy blocks"
2021-12-31 01:23:17	NealRame	now I understand. thanks for that
2021-12-31 01:23:24	ilikepeaches	similarly https://ptpimg.me/cjzteo.png
2021-12-31 01:23:32	NealRame	gimme one sec, I'll generate some ultra high res specs
2021-12-31 01:24:05	NealRame	after the dinner, actually. my stomach is shouting at me. will post here
2021-12-31 01:24:06	ilikepeaches	two-second zoom starting somewhere in the track that's suspect is what those are
2021-12-31 01:24:13	ilikepeaches	i probably will not still be around
2021-12-31 01:24:58	NealRame	all good, you'd see later if curious. I'll post the album link here for the interested. cheers

2021-12-31 07:47:28	infinitycircuit	ok, at 4800 torrents in transmission-daemon...it's the moment of truth for whether i should just keep adding to it or switch to multiple rtorrents of 5k each
2021-12-31 07:47:34	infinitycircuit	this is stressing me out haha
2021-12-31 07:47:38	Grohl	Feel ya
2021-12-31 07:49:15	infinitycircuit	i had transmission get OOM killed the other day...i think that torrenting + jellyfin + airsonic-advanced (which also dies regularly trying to index my music) is just too much for this rpi4
