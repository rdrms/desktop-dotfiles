2021-02-09 19:56:20	rdr	hello, can anyone tell me what package provides autoreconf?
2021-02-09 19:56:44	rdr	wait i found it
2021-02-09 19:56:53	rdr	i didn't use the -c for system.devel
2021-02-09 19:57:04	rdr	sudo eopkg install -c system.devel
2021-02-09 19:58:13	sheepman[m]	That'll do it!

2021-02-09 20:00:50	rdr	thanks sheepman[m], i'm really enjoying solus
2021-02-09 20:01:03	rdr	i just had FreeBSD die on me, so I went with something a little more familiar
2021-02-09 20:01:12	rdr	it's quite fast
2021-02-09 20:01:28	sheepman[m]	Yeah, it is. I'm glad you're enjoying it!
2021-02-09 20:04:59	sheepman[m]	This won't help you if the package isn't installed, but in case you ever need to find what package installed some file, you can use "eopkg search-file" or "eopkg sf" to find out. That's how I was gonna tell you it was autoconf until you found it yourself
2021-02-09 20:06:34	rdr	search-file, i will try to remember that

2021-02-09 20:06:43	rdr	would that have shown me autoconf when i search autoreconf?
2021-02-09 20:07:02	sheepman[m]	Only if you already had the package installed
2021-02-09 20:07:11	rdr	ah
2021-02-09 20:07:19	rdr	is there a "provides" sort of thing?
2021-02-09 20:07:39	sheepman[m]	So it wouldn't have helped you there, but it's very useful when you, say, modify something you weren't supposed to and need to know what to install. Ask me how I know.
2021-02-09 20:07:51	sheepman[m]	s/install/reinstall
2021-02-09 20:08:08	rdr	lol i can imagine
2021-02-09 20:09:21	sheepman[m]	I don't think there's anything integrated that lets you search for what package provides a file
2021-02-09 20:10:07	sheepman[m]	Someone other than me could probably provide more info, but I usually end up googling it and trying to translate package names.
2021-02-09 20:26:50	rdr	okay, well thanks for responding and trying to help

2021-02-10 07:30:14	raomohsinkhan	@ermo I can only install those application which are placed at Solus repository?
2021-02-10 07:30:36	@ermo	Yes.
2021-02-10 07:30:46	@JoshStrobl	No you can install applications you build yourself as well.
2021-02-10 07:30:56	@ermo	yes, but they're not from our upstream repo =)
2021-02-10 07:30:56	@JoshStrobl	But officially supported applications are from the repo.
2021-02-10 07:31:37	@ermo	raomohsinkhan: out of curiousity, why do you want an older gedit?
2021-02-10 07:31:46	raomohsinkhan	will Solus increase application it's reposiotry in future?
2021-02-10 07:31:57	@ermo	raomohsinkhan: do you plan to help us do it?
2021-02-10 07:32:35	raomohsinkhan	@ermo in older gedit have a menu bar, file, edit,about etc..
2021-02-10 07:32:48	@JoshStrobl	We don't support having multiple providers of the same package.
2021-02-10 07:32:49	@ermo	if you must, try pluma instead
2021-02-10 07:33:03	@ermo	that uses a menu bar (it's from MATE and is also GTK3)
2021-02-10 07:33:12	raomohsinkhan	ok, thank you

2021-02-10 10:52:11	aliakbar	Hi
2021-02-10 10:52:29	sheepman[m]	Hello!
2021-02-10 10:53:09	aliakbar	I'm trying to find the best mtu settings for my network and when I try "ping" in Konsole on Solus KDE, there's no "-m" (hint) option
2021-02-10 10:53:38	aliakbar	according to (https://linux.die.net/man/8/ping) there should be an -m parameter right?
2021-02-10 10:54:22	sheepman[m]	are you doing -m or -M?
2021-02-10 10:55:01	sheepman[m]	looks like it's a capital M in this case
2021-02-10 10:55:22	aliakbar	tried both, even when I issue "ping --help" there's no -m or -M listed in the options!
2021-02-10 10:55:45	aliakbar	I get "ping: invalid option -- 'M'"
2021-02-10 10:56:02	sheepman[m]	oh you're right
2021-02-10 10:57:38	sheepman[m]	I'm not sure why that is...
2021-02-10 10:58:53	aliakbar	Yeah I guess it may be a version difference! I'm not sure
2021-02-10 10:59:42	sheepman[m]	One sec, let me check something
2021-02-10 11:00:31	aliakbar	so ping is a part of "iputils" package, and I found (https://github.com/iputils/iputils) released their latest version 8 days ago, how can I update to this? I guess I should build from source code, but replacing the one on the machine with this seems more than just a build...
2021-02-10 11:00:45	algent|	Are you looking for `--mask`
2021-02-10 11:01:31	aliakbar	@algent no it says "hint" for the name of this option, it's responsible for packet fragmentation policy, is mask the same?
2021-02-10 11:02:23	algent|	I don't know
2021-02-10 11:03:17	algent|	Maybe it is deprecated
2021-02-10 11:05:00	algent|	sheepman[m], It is from `inetutils`
2021-02-10 11:05:11	sheepman[m]	yeah, I saw that
2021-02-10 11:05:41	sheepman[m]	looking for something in the inetutils package that would make ping different from what it is on other distros, can't find anything
2021-02-10 11:07:04	@JoshStrobl	algent|, ping for us is part of inetutils, not iputils. We do have iputils in the repository, however have renamed its ping to iputils-ping to avoid conflicts.
2021-02-10 11:07:54	sheepman[m]	I think I was about 10 seconds from realizing that, Josh
2021-02-10 11:08:01	sheepman[m]	aliakbar: does that help you?

2021-02-10 11:09:58	aliakbar	Thanks everybody for the clarification, so I installed "iputils-ping" with eopkg and now my ping has the -m option. Thumbs up!
2021-02-10 11:11:10	aliakbar	But may I ask what's the reason behind this decision? Is the inetutils package a better maintained one? Because it seems like a stripped down version compared to the usual iputils.
2021-02-10 11:13:32	@JoshStrobl	I just don't think anyone has given an extensive enough look to determine if the iputils implementation is fully compatible with the legacy inetutils to ensure backwards compatibility with external applications. Bigger priorities than that at the moment (at least for the team).

However, this was fixed in a later build and building from source is successful. Is it ok to create the package still tagged as version 3.0Beta7 even though it's from a newer build?

2021-02-11 07:35:59	youngster	The File Manager on Solus 4.2 Plasma is Dolphin. It has problems with playing movies over a Samba share (like from as NAS). I find that Budgie works fine because it uses Nautilus for its File Manager.

2021-02-11 07:41:03	youngster	and.... is this the proper place to report such problems? I would think the Solus dev team would be interested in such feedback
2021-02-11 07:41:46	@DataDrake|zzz	that's not a Solus issue
2021-02-11 07:42:17	TraceyC	That would be best filed against the Dolphin software, if there isn't an issue open already
2021-02-11 07:42:29	TraceyC	In the Plasma / KDE tracker
2021-02-11 07:42:49	@DataDrake|zzz	That's like filing a complain with your car dealer because you tried vehicle A and B but B does something A doesn't
2021-02-11 07:43:10	TraceyC	yeah
2021-02-11 07:44:32	youngster	okay, sorry to be a bother
2021-02-11 07:44:59	@DataDrake|zzz	it's not a bother, I just can't fix it lol
2021-02-11 07:45:45	youngster	I fixed it by removing Dolphin and replacing it with Nautilus
2021-02-11 07:46:23	@DataDrake|zzz	we're not swapping the default file manager just because it falls over in one use case
2021-02-11 07:46:39	youngster	I guess I should report it to the KDE folks
2021-02-11 07:47:18	Harvey	I just played a mkv from a samba share in dolphin.
2021-02-11 07:47:29	Harvey	No issue.
2021-02-11 07:47:53	@DataDrake|zzz	samba or SMB?
2021-02-11 07:48:01	youngster	SMB
2021-02-11 07:48:42	@DataDrake|zzz	I'm asking because SMB != Samba
2021-02-11 07:48:47	youngster	It's a permissions problem that Dolphin doesn't handle well
2021-02-11 07:49:03	@DataDrake|zzz	well yeah
2021-02-11 07:49:16	@DataDrake|zzz	CIFS is totally different than unix permissions
2021-02-11 07:49:34	@DataDrake|zzz	there's all sorts of weirdness
2021-02-11 07:49:42	youngster	of course, but Nautilus deals with it just fine
2021-02-11 07:49:59	youngster	thanks for your help
2021-02-11 07:50:27	youngster	I'll bring it up with the KDE filks

2021-02-12 02:43:05	g_	hi, could someone explain why some applications installed are not visible in the dropdown menu?
2021-02-12 02:47:33	@JoshStrobl	If you are using Budgie, it's possible the Budgie Menu's underlying lib, libgnome-menus, didn't properly communicate all the new desktop files after the application database was updated. Try opening up a Terminal, then doing: budgie-panel --replace &! followed by Ctrl+D to detach from that process.
2021-02-12 02:50:20	g_	I'll give you an example: budgie shutdown timer is installed but doesn't appear anywhere so cannot be launched, which rather negates having it installed...
2021-02-12 02:51:06	@JoshStrobl	You need to relog, Budgie's PluginManager doesn't currently reload to display newly available plugins, that inotify-related functionality is planned for the future.
2021-02-12 02:51:41	@JoshStrobl	It won't immediately "appear" anywhere but should show up in Budgie Desktop Settings, where the rest of the applets are when you click to add them in a panel.
2021-02-12 02:52:00	g_	it is not listed in applets
2021-02-12 02:52:14	@JoshStrobl	As I stated, you need to relog.
2021-02-12 02:52:37	@JoshStrobl	If you just installed it, it will not automatically be added to the list.
2021-02-12 02:54:28	g_	I have not recently installed it separately, it came with budgie and a feature I need
2021-02-12 02:54:36	@JoshStrobl	It does not come with Budgie.
2021-02-12 02:54:49	@JoshStrobl	It is a third-party applet developed by Ubuntu Budgie.
2021-02-12 02:55:14	@JoshStrobl	It is available in our repository.
2021-02-12 02:57:43	g_	I know it's available in your repository, and when I go to software center it's listed as installed but as I said before is NOT visible anywhere so CANNOT be launched!
2021-02-12 02:58:05	g_	which is quite stupid
2021-02-12 02:58:09	<--	JoshStrobl has kicked g_ (g_)
2021-02-12 02:59:01	@Girtablulu	can he not read?
2021-02-12 02:59:08	@JoshStrobl	Apparently not.
2021-02-12 02:59:17	@JoshStrobl	Don't have the patience for that.

2021-02-12 18:57:50	mickotronic	Hi all, would you recommend using falkon browser? Seems like it has a long time between releases, but does it use a newish qtwebengine? Just wondering cause firefox seems to have a pretty bad memory leaks (no extensions) and falkon seems pretty cool, just don't know if it's as safe to use for general browsing
2021-02-12 19:06:46	Harvey	I wouldn't use it. If you want to try another browser I would use vivaldi

2021-02-13 08:03:20	_shawn	so I want to remove mime types from the .desktop file, but if I do that an update overwrites my changes, and chattr +i prevents the update. eopkg just exits when it reaches that file

2021-02-13 12:50:58	_shawn	I dont have experience doing that exactly mw42815 , but if you `eopkg install` it it will show you how many things it will try to pull in
2021-02-13 12:51:29	_shawn	and read that, and decide, and if you try it and change your mind you can roll back the install using `eopkg history`
2021-02-13 12:52:09	mw42815	okay.  i am going to try it .  thanks
2021-02-13 12:52:13	@JoshStrobl	mw42815, you can't change it in the Default applications section since GNOME Control Center only lets you specify a few types of file types there and not stuff like inode/directory, but you *should* be able to install caja, remove nautilus, and caja be the default inode/directory handler. If it doesn't work by default, you can modify .config/mimeapps.list

2021-02-13 19:05:11	Gryman	Hey guys, I'm trying to play Rocksmith on Steam and my Real Tone Cable isn't being detected as an input.
2021-02-13 19:05:19	Gryman	Does anyone play this game?
2021-02-13 19:07:24	rdr	what's a real tone cable
2021-02-13 19:07:48	Gryman	1/4" audio to USB
2021-02-13 19:07:57	Gryman	It's so you can connect your guitar or bass to the computer
2021-02-13 19:08:06	rdr	ohhh okay
2021-02-13 19:08:11	rdr	you may have to find a driver for it
2021-02-13 19:08:15	rdr	which may or may not exist
2021-02-13 19:08:29	rdr	unplug it, and type "lsusb" in the terminal
2021-02-13 19:08:35	rdr	plug it in, and do the command again
2021-02-13 19:08:37	rdr	see what changes

2021-02-13 19:09:35	rdr	if it says it's disconnected
2021-02-13 19:09:58	Gryman	I tried setting ALSA for Wine, and then opening the Wine config and it doesn't list Alsa or the input
2021-02-13 19:13:09	Gryman	The only inputs I have for Wine are Pulseaudio
2021-02-13 19:13:46	rdr	the link i shared says sometimes you have to temporarily disable pulseaudio
2021-02-13 19:15:10	Gryman	I see it says to disable the cable in Pulse, but I don't see where it says to disable pulseaudio
2021-02-13 19:15:24	Gryman	And the /etc/pulse/daemon.conf doesn't exist on my system it seems
2021-02-13 19:16:02	Gryman	Oh, the other link

2021-02-13 21:32:36	live_johnv	Hello Guys, the is anyone online ?
2021-02-13 21:33:21	live_johnv	Maybe i just found a bug in solus 4.2 installation process...but i am not shure
2021-02-13 21:38:02	live_johnv	Anyways, i am using solus 4.2 (Gnome) live session right now. I started the installer and now i am stuck in "examining local storage devices". This is happening booth with gnome and budgie versions. But only with Solus 4.2 ISOś... for me the only way to install Solus was download the 4.1 ISO and then update to 4.2
2021-02-13 21:40:30	live_johnv	I ust want to report this issue and maybe you guys take a look at it. Solus is a great system and works very well with my hardware. Is the fastest distro that i ever tested.
2021-02-13 21:42:50	sheepman[m]	live_johnv: and it worked fine on the 4.2 iso?
2021-02-13 21:43:05	sheepman[m]	er, the 4.1 iso
2021-02-13 21:43:20	sheepman[m]	...must be late at night
2021-02-13 21:43:33	live_johnv	Yes, worked just fine
2021-02-13 21:44:27	sheepman[m]	Odd. That's the first I've heard of installation issues on 4.2, but then I'm also not one of the maintainers- I just hang out in IRC
2021-02-13 21:44:51	live_johnv	I just trying to decide between Gnome or Bugie versions, this is not easy  haha :)
2021-02-13 21:45:42	sheepman[m]	Heh. I'm sure you can find many opinionated people to "help" with that
2021-02-13 21:46:17	sheepman[m]	Of the two, I like Budgie, but I'll admit to using Plasma on most systems
2021-02-13 21:47:01	sheepman[m]	In any case, I'm glad you got it working. Welcome to Solus!
2021-02-13 21:48:18	live_johnv	Thank you Sheepman :) I am glad to be here
2021-02-13 21:48:44	live_johnv	i know that is late. Maybe i will comeback tomorrow.
2021-02-13 21:49:20	sheepman[m]	Indeed! There's usually someone around who will help out if you wait long enough
2021-02-13 21:49:59	live_johnv	Great ! it is good to know
2021-02-13 21:50:18	live_johnv	Bye...and have a good night
2021-02-13 21:50:21	sheepman[m]	Good luck with your DE decision!
