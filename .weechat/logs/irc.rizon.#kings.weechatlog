2021-12-06 10:39:09	+bloom	I love peepeepoopies, folks. Yes that is right, I love to have peepeepoopies. One of my favorite things to do is take a laxative on weekends when I have absolute nothing to do and I know I’ll be at the house all day. Sometimes when I can’t wait the 8 hours a laxative will take I’ll do a salt water flush and I’ll be peeing out my butthole in 30 minutes. I’ve even found for
2021-12-06 10:39:09	+bloom	methat 100% grapefruit juice will do the trick if I drink half a gallon in a day. There are so many aspects of it that make it one of the best experiences. The first aspect I love is the rush. Just going about my business and then all of a sudden I know I might poop my pants. That it is time to get on a toilet right now and nothing else matters. It’s an adrenaline rush when the
2021-12-06 10:39:09	+bloom	stomachstarts to gurgle and you know you can’t stop what’s about to happen. That I am totally at the mercy of my bowels. The second is simply the feeling. I love the feeling of relief I get in my stomach, the feeling of it rushing out of my butt hole, and it is one of those good burn feelings in the butt hole too. I love that fiery butt hole burn. Then when you go to wipe it’s
2021-12-06 10:39:09	+bloom	kind oflike you are scratching that ultimate itch. To put it simply from start to finish the feeling of peepeepoopies has multiple aspects that all feel good and all of them have their special place in my heart. The third aspect I love is the smell. It’s like when you have a good fart and it stinks really bad and you kind of sniff it in and you are like dang, I just did that. The
2021-12-06 10:39:09	+bloom	smell ofpeepeepoopies is like I just opened a sewer line right in my toilet and I love it. It’s just a great scent to sit there and enjoy for a minute. A nasty type of good that makes you feel a little dirty. The fourth aspect would have to be looking at what came out. Just standing to wipe and looking at what once used to be a perfectly clean toilet is now black. Just black water
2021-12-06 10:39:10	+bloom	with blackspatter all around the bowl of the toilet. I love to stand there for a second and look at it and say “dang look at all that bad stuff I just expelled from my body.” That’s a great feeling looking at it and knowing how you’ve just purged your body. Folks, I highly recommend peepeepoopies.

2021-12-06 12:59:20	&watitdew	The cold takes I'm seeing regarding Patriot Front are really getting to me for one core reason: they betray a fundamental ignorance of, or worse, an unwillingness to learn from everything we've witnessed in terms of IRL political activity since 2015.
2021-12-06 12:59:20	&watitdew	An honest study of the past half decade of right wing street demonstrations and activism would understand the need for anonymity, physical fitness, racial homogeneity, *actual operational security* and not sending fedposts via protonmail and calling that "opsec", etc. How else can you structure and organize an effective, real world force than something made up of young, white, fit, militantly hierarchical men? It's not that the copes and 
2021-12-06 12:59:20	&watitdew	deflections are pathetic, and they are, it's that they have learned nothing from all the blood, sweat, tears, and personal devastation that serve no other purpose than to teach them to learn from other's mistakes. They'd rather run headfirst right back into the Capitol Building with a MAGA hat on and their home address tattooed on their face than actually reflect upon the mistakes of others and improve themselves. Borzoi is correct in 
2021-12-06 12:59:24	&watitdew	saying right wingers are terminally retarded.

2021-12-07 11:04:38	&Tantivy	[10:38:21] so like if you decide to seed a file and it turns out someone else was doing the same, you don't need to know anything about that person/network
2021-12-07 11:04:38	%dumbgoy	[10:38:32] got any good ipfs links?
2021-12-07 11:04:38	&Tantivy	[10:38:33] the file is shared via the same hash and you both help to seed it
2021-12-07 11:04:38	&Tantivy	[10:38:40] what like
2021-12-07 11:04:38	%dumbgoy	[10:38:48] i've tried using the protocol but never found anything of real interest and it took forever to load
2021-12-07 11:04:38	&Tantivy	[10:39:10] there are a few 'search engines'
2021-12-07 11:04:38	&Tantivy	[10:39:16] but yeah it's basically in its infancy now
2021-12-07 11:04:38	&Tantivy	[10:39:21] that's why i'm trying to push it out of that
2021-12-07 11:04:38	&Tantivy	[10:39:24] by emphasising

2021-12-07 11:04:38	~bean_curd	[10:41:09] can i make a kike index

2021-12-07 11:04:38	~bean_curd	[10:41:34] or is it the other way around - first ovens then kikes

2021-12-07 11:04:38	&Tantivy	[10:42:16] yes my finest achievement to date
2021-12-07 11:04:38	%Kowal	[10:45:38] I've been checking out this ham radio thing, called aredn
2021-12-07 11:04:38	%Kowal	[10:45:43] it's pretty cool
2021-12-07 11:04:38	%Kowal	[10:46:08] you create a node that automatically connects to other nodes, given that they are reachable with radio waves
2021-12-07 11:04:38	&Tantivy	[10:46:37] just gave me a good idea ty also i'll check that out
2021-12-07 11:04:38	%Kowal	[10:46:42] and you can do basically everything you can do with the internet, but there's no infrastructure needed
2021-12-07 11:04:38	&Tantivy	[10:46:57] it's like packet radio then?
2021-12-07 11:04:38	%Kowal	[10:47:02] my problem is I live in the middle of nowhere, and no one around me has a node
2021-12-07 11:04:38	%Kowal	[10:47:15] yeah, like packet radio, only faster and better
2021-12-07 11:04:38	%Kowal	[10:47:21] you can do 10 MBS
2021-12-07 11:04:38	%Kowal	[10:47:40] you can stream videos, have websites, basically anything
2021-12-07 11:04:38	%dumbgoy	[10:47:58] shit nigga the no intro rom collection is on ipfs
2021-12-07 11:04:38	%dumbgoy	[10:48:00] cool

2021-12-07 11:04:38	%Kowal	[10:48:47] it would be really cool if shtf and internet went down
2021-12-07 11:04:38	%Kowal	[10:48:53] you have your own intranet
2021-12-07 11:04:38	%Kowal	[10:49:14] and as long as you could connect to another node, you have access to every node that node can connect to
2021-12-07 11:04:38	&Tantivy	[10:56:59] radio intranets + content addressing

2021-12-08 10:50:04	%Kowal	>If the man’s world is said to be the State, his struggle, his readiness to devote his powers to the service of the community, then it may perhaps be said that the woman’s is a smaller world. For her world is her husband, her family, her children, and her home. But what would become of the greater world if there were no one to tend and care for the smaller one? How could the
2021-12-08 10:50:05	%Kowal	greater world survive if there were no one to make the cares of the smaller world the content of their lives?
2021-12-08 10:50:19	%Kowal	>No, the greater world is built on the foundation of this smaller world. This great world cannot survive if the smaller world is not stable. Providence has entrusted to the woman the cares of that world which is her very own, and only on the basis of this smaller world can the man’s world be formed and built up. The two worlds are not antagonistic. They complement each other, they
2021-12-08 10:50:21	%Kowal	belong together just as man and woman belong together.

2021-12-08 11:13:27	~bean_curd	“Our data shows that people who had been vaccinated and then tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to report sneezing as a symptom compared with those without a jab,” researchers wrote, according to The Hill.

2021-12-08 13:54:48	osnap	[13:21:30] finally getting around to watching this crowder w/ rittenhouse
2021-12-08 13:54:48	osnap	[13:21:54] they asked what hes gonna do with the AR, he said his team is sending a motion/request for the police to destroy it. its still in their possession
2021-12-08 13:54:48	osnap	[13:22:10] i think thats the right choice. some people were like, he should auction it etc. im like uhhh thats a good way to keep pouring gas on the fire
2021-12-08 13:54:48	+obscure	[13:22:19] at firsts I lol'd @ crazy bitch retard but then it occured to me that she is probably an elementary school teacher
2021-12-08 13:54:48	+obscure	[13:22:23] https://kohlchan.net/.media/f64a34f9d1b8f29659eec50e8cf021e81c338012f4a7dcaa78edd825771743cc.mp4
2021-12-08 13:54:48	%Kowal	[13:23:03] yeah, zimmerman wound up selling his gun
2021-12-08 13:54:48	+obscure	[13:24:07] osnap, he sent out a nice thank you note to people who sent money to his defense. I felt it was a fine time to unsubscribe and hope the future blesses him with obscurity.
2021-12-08 13:54:48	osnap	[13:24:09] i just have an overwhelmingly bad feeling it isnt over, rittenhouse is certainly going to be targetted. if not by actual misled people that think hes a racist, by some organization, likely working within the governement, that wants to keep the flames fanned
2021-12-08 13:54:48	osnap	[13:24:44] obscure: yeah tbh i cringed the other day when i noticed he was going on various peoples podcast. i was kinda hoping he just tried to stay off the grid as much as possible
2021-12-08 13:54:48	osnap	[13:26:07] i think feel like there is an inherent danger in calling someone that was just acting in self defense a hero. dont get me wrong, his actions i think in many respects are heroic. he went to clean up grafitti, volunteering to do good for the community, tried to provide medical assitance to people, even the criminals themsevles that were out looting. thats all very admirable
2021-12-08 13:54:48	osnap	[13:26:38] but the focus seems to keep getting put on him being a hero because he shot 3 people in self defense. thats bound to get muddied up a great deal
2021-12-08 13:54:48	%Kowal	[13:28:44] yeah, they are going to try and destroy this kid's life just like they did to zimmerman
2021-12-08 13:54:48	%Kowal	[13:28:48] probably
2021-12-08 13:54:48	&Tantivy	[13:29:46] how about we crucify that satanic cunt obscure

2021-12-08 13:54:48	&Tantivy	[13:36:17]  yes some nigger boxer is probably going to challenge kyle
2021-12-08 13:54:48	&Tantivy	[13:36:28] but i feel that situation itself will die down
2021-12-08 13:54:48	&Tantivy	[13:36:45] there are always things deep state niggers can and are in the process of spinning up
2021-12-08 13:54:48	&Tantivy	[13:37:11] the runaway car without any driver whatsoever in waukesha is perhaps one such example
2021-12-08 13:54:48	&Tantivy	[13:37:38] maybe somebody will set fire to a giant christmas display
2021-12-08 13:54:48	&Tantivy	[13:37:41] that kind of thing

2021-12-08 19:08:59	&watitdew	It appeared that there had even been demonstrations to thank Big Brother for only needing six injections for full vaccination. And only yesterday, he reflected, it had been announced that full vaccination was 3 injections. Was it possible that they could swallow that, after only twenty-four hours? Yes, they swallowed it. They swallowed it easily, with the stupidity of an animal. The eyeless creature at the other table swallowed it 
2021-12-08 19:08:59	&watitdew	fanatically, passionately, with a furious desire to track down, denounce, and vaporize anyone who should suggest that last week full vaccination was simply two injections.

2021-12-11 11:48:09	&Tantivy	>The Patriot Front is led by Thomas Ryan Rousseau, who was a teenager at the time he founded the group. Rousseau had taken control of Vanguard America’s web server and Discord channel several weeks prior to the Unite the Right rally, which Rousseau had participated in as the leader of Vanguard America’s contingent.
2021-12-11 11:48:18	&Tantivy	>ollowing the bad press arising from the rally, Rousseau left Vanguard. He used the group’s domain name to form the Patriot Front as an ostensibly new group, and recruit rally participants, although most of the Patriot Front’s members were former Vanguard members.

2021-12-11 11:49:50	&Tantivy	>Just remember that Patriot Front was the same mysterious group to pop up at Unite the Right, shout “White Sharia Now!” and then have one of their “unofficial” members commit a staged Islamic-style terror attack in order to demonize real pro-Whites.

2021-12-31 07:57:39	%rdr	I am Andrew Ryan, and I'm here to ask you a question. Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow? 'No!' says the man in Washington, 'It belongs to the poor.' 'No!' says the man in the Vatican, 'It belongs to God.' 'No!' says the man in Moscow, 'It belongs to everyone.' I rejected those answers; instead, I chose something different. I chose the impossible. I chose... #kings, a board
