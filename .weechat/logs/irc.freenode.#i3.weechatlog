2018-08-23 00:57:20	rydare	you can also copy them to ~/.local/share/applications/

2018-08-23 10:32:21	dRbiG	over the years I've settled on a setup that just works for me
2018-08-23 10:32:35	dRbiG	I'm more reluctant to try out new shiny things
2018-08-23 10:32:45	dRbiG	though, I had a couple of months I've switched to cwm
2018-08-23 10:34:41	dRbiG	only thing I miss in dmenu is lack of tab completion for stuff from $PATH
2018-08-23 10:34:44	dRbiG	prolly fixable
2018-08-23 10:37:30	dRbiG	huh
2018-08-23 10:38:35	dRbiG	:D fixed
2018-08-23 10:38:48	dRbiG	and that's why I stick with linSux
2018-08-23 10:39:07	dRbiG	it may suck, it does, it does much less so than alternatives
2018-08-23 10:40:31	dRbiG	btw. with my ssd dying I did a clean install + most of /home from backup (arch linux)
2018-08-23 10:40:50	dRbiG	I think I can now recommend even more xfce4 base + i3

2018-08-23 10:41:16	dRbiG	and by base I mean running some infra from there and i3, as opposed to xfce with the wm replaced by i3
2018-08-23 10:49:48	@squigzy	I start with an effectively empty Debian installation and then install i3 and rofi :P
2018-08-23 10:51:51	dRbiG	and that's te beauty of this ecosystem :)
2018-08-23 10:55:19	nuth	I used fluxbox up until last week, but always wanted to try a tiling wm and someone recommended i3, and I must say I'm impressed
2018-08-23 10:56:27	nuth	the only thing I'm missing is the ability to split the config into smaller files... just for organization
2018-08-23 10:56:52	nuth	though i just remembered vim has nice folding ability... so maybe I can make due with that

2018-08-23 12:21:46	michaelrose	or if you prefer the cli xdg-mime gvfs-mime alternatively gio mime

2018-08-23 12:40:42	michaelrose	what do you get for python --version
2018-08-23 12:41:13	michaelrose	also wondering why call it via python /path/to/script instead of just exec /path/to/script
2018-08-23 12:41:44	segurb	3.7.0
2018-08-23 12:41:53	segurb	because I am a newb
2018-08-23 12:42:13	michaelrose	make sure its set executable chmod +x /my/file
2018-08-23 12:42:35	michaelrose	and try it without an unneeded step and tell me if it works
2018-08-23 12:45:19	segurb	its executable but
2018-08-23 12:45:23	segurb	doesnt work without python call
2018-08-23 12:45:37	michaelrose	I've always wondered why python doesn't just run main if it exists instead of making you do if __name__ ==  '__main__':
2018-08-23 12:46:04	michaelrose	that is truly weird
2018-08-23 12:46:18	michaelrose	is your hashbang screwed up?
2018-08-23 12:46:51	michaelrose	logically you ought to have python3 in path
2018-08-23 12:47:39	segurb	no its not
2018-08-23 12:47:50	segurb	/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/lib/jvm/default/bin:/usr/bin/site_perl:/usr/bin/vendor_perl:/usr/bin/core_perl
2018-08-23 12:47:52	segurb	its not in the PATH
2018-08-23 12:47:56	segurb	and its not hasbang
2018-08-23 12:48:03	segurb	like, if I run just the script in terminal it works
2018-08-23 12:48:09	segurb	its only tourgh i3 bind that it does not
2018-08-23 12:48:39	michaelrose	ok so running /path/to/my/script works without the python call?
2018-08-23 12:49:16	michaelrose	but not if you bind a key to it
2018-08-23 12:50:16	segurb	yes
2018-08-23 12:50:44	segurb	https://0x0.st/sywd.jpg
2018-08-23 12:50:46	segurb	see :D
2018-08-23 12:51:58	michaelrose	as an aside kid of weird that it takes + 1 instead of +1
2018-08-23 12:53:29	mduk	unusual certainly, but it does make sense, $operation and $argument. :D
2018-08-23 12:53:44	mduk	(please forgive the intrusion)
2018-08-23 12:53:44	michaelrose	seems like it ought to check if the argument string begins with + or - and if some add or subtract from current or if not set to value
2018-08-23 12:53:59	michaelrose	then it would always take a singular argument
2018-08-23 12:56:04	michaelrose	ok does it work if you spell out the path instead of using ~
2018-08-23 12:59:21	segurb	michaelrose: already tried that, nope
2018-08-23 13:01:46	segurb	michaelrose: do you want to know what was wrong?
2018-08-23 13:01:48	segurb	it was me
2018-08-23 13:01:55	segurb	I have thinkpad, i replaced in UEFI FN with CTRL
2018-08-23 13:01:59	segurb	and I was clicking on what says to be CTRL
2018-08-23 13:02:01	segurb	instead of FN
2018-08-23 13:02:03	segurb	XD
2018-08-23 13:02:04	michaelrose	haha
2018-08-23 13:02:11	segurb	it works with full path, with and without python,m and with ~
2018-08-23 13:02:13	segurb	sooooo yeah
2018-08-23 13:02:20	michaelrose	I have found when something doesn't work its better than average something I'm doing wrong
2018-08-23 13:02:48	mduk	segurb: nice one, i love it when that happens. that's an easy fix! :D
2018-08-23 13:07:39	segurb	Thanks for mental help guys :D

2018-08-25 08:43:56	CannedSpinach	[14:33:24] anyone here use dolphin with i3? I can't get it to work with a dark theme.
2018-08-25 08:43:56	CannedSpinach	[14:34:44] dolphin file manager btw, not dolphin emu.
2018-08-25 08:43:56	okraits	[14:35:31] i3 has nothing to do with the qt theme, maybe you need some kde service
2018-08-25 08:43:56	CannedSpinach	[14:36:06] okraits: I set the QT theme already using qt5ct. it still looks awful in i3.
2018-08-25 08:43:56	CannedSpinach	[14:37:49] it's purely a dolphin problem too, other Qt5 programs (such as keepassxc) seem to work fine.

I used to be able to tile fullscreen windows to left or right in plasma/kwin setup by binding a shortcut to "tile window to left/right", it would stay fullscreen but only took half of the screen. If I am correct, i3 does not support this functionality?

2018-08-26 03:09:17	eyeoh	coldpresent: although yeah, my i3status has hung before but only because of weird applets - as you said, mod+shift+r almost always fixes it.

2018-08-26 08:08:45	alex``	I would like something like:

2018-08-26 08:09:29	alex``	That could be useful to have a Reader-like mode like in Mac
2018-08-26 08:10:03	alex``	So that fullscreen enable [100] [100] by default

2018-08-26 08:48:23	***	Buffer Playback...
2018-08-26 08:48:23	tecepe	[08:36:20] for example, i have 3 instances of the same program that i'd be willing to bring up in different moments, without changing the workspace
2018-08-26 08:48:23	tecepe	[08:37:46] i could have them in a floating container and just bring them up with a key using scratchpads
2018-08-26 08:48:23	tecepe	[08:38:16] (to do that now, i need to use 3 keys, and i have to remember each one is each)
2018-08-26 08:48:23	tecepe	[08:39:07] any other idea to workaround is welcome as well =)
2018-08-26 08:48:23	eyeoh	[08:44:17] which program is it?
2018-08-26 08:48:23	tecepe	[08:46:12] hi, eyoh. well, in this exact moment i'm thinking of zim. but i had this feeling with other programs as well.
2018-08-26 08:48:23	tecepe	[08:47:57] eyeoh* hehe
