2021-02-11 09:04:22	fighters52	Anyone here on a Lemmy server?
2021-02-11 10:12:42	rdr	i don't know what that is
2021-02-11 10:12:44	rdr	so probably not
2021-02-11 11:09:53	Westernesse	fighters52: Lemmy as in the federated Reddit alternative?
2021-02-11 12:19:27	fighters52	Yes, correct.
2021-02-11 12:33:47	Westernesse	I'm waiting for the selection of instances to be a bit more extensive. I think I may have tested out the main Lemmy instance at some point, though.
2021-02-11 12:35:54	fighters52	They are not friendly to Catholic discussion. I was thinking of setting up an instance for those who are Catholic or whose values are somewhat compatible. 
2021-02-11 12:37:52	Westernesse	Do you have some examples of their unfriendliness? Kinda curious.
2021-02-11 12:38:15	luke-jr	Mastodon is similar, though there's some anti-censorship instances
2021-02-11 12:38:24	Westernesse	I know some Mastodon instances ban the benign rcsocial instance out of general anti-catholicism reasons.
2021-02-11 12:39:08	Westernesse	But most don't, since the users don't spam and harass.
2021-02-11 12:39:17	luke-jr	bitcoinhackers.org is blocked by some because bitcoiners have moved to Mastodon in response to Twitter censorship XD
2021-02-11 12:40:36	fighters52	I messaged the founder and host of the main instance. I asked if we would be welcome there. He said no.
2021-02-11 12:40:37	Westernesse	Yeah, I know a bunch of explicitly left-wing instances ban everything that's potentially related to libertarianism &c., and they'd certainly consider Bitcoin enthusiasts to fall under that.
2021-02-11 12:40:49	Westernesse	Did he give specific reasons?
2021-02-11 12:41:17	Westernesse	But yeah, Lemmy is pretty explicitly left-wing. And the founder is controversial even among other far-left people.
2021-02-11 12:41:28	fighters52	He said, "No, we don't allow right wing communities on lemmy."
2021-02-11 12:41:32	Westernesse	There's a rivalry between Lemmy and Raddle, for example.
2021-02-11 12:41:37	Westernesse	Ah
2021-02-11 12:41:53	Westernesse	Did you say anything beyond wanting a catholic community?
2021-02-11 12:42:15	fighters52	I referenced two on Reddit and asked if something similiar would be okay on Lemmy.
2021-02-11 12:42:24	fighters52	That's it.
2021-02-11 12:42:26	Westernesse	Which ones did you refer to?
2021-02-11 12:42:52	fighters52	Catholicism and TraditionalCatholics
2021-02-11 12:43:44	Westernesse	To be honest, I can see why he'd reject.
2021-02-11 12:43:45	luke-jr	both of those are anti-Catholic :P
2021-02-11 12:44:22	Westernesse	luke-jr: That's not why he'd reject, haha.
2021-02-11 12:44:35	fighters52	I do not know enough about these things to be confident in setting one up but I am thinking of giving it a try.
2021-02-11 12:45:30	Westernesse	You probably want to give a better value proposition. The federation is an important aspect of Lemmy's appeal.
2021-02-11 12:46:59	Westernesse	You pretty much want to sell it with a set of rules that looks acceptable to someone with his perspective, while not being harmful to your community.
2021-02-11 12:49:13	Westernesse	 /r/TraditionalCatholics/ can be off-putting. The sidebar uses the word "degeneracy", some of the forums it linked to seem overwhelmed with conspiracy theories and far-right advocacy, it mentions /r/Conservative (a rather controversial subreddit) as a friend.
2021-02-11 12:51:45	Westernesse	Charitable and polite discussion about catholic subject matter will probably be seen as silly and antiquated, but not as unacceptable.
2021-02-11 12:52:28	Westernesse	Things like https://lemmy.ml/c/catholicmemes petered out, but don't appear banned from the main instance.
2021-02-11 12:52:40	fighters52	But I could also just create a separate instance of Lemmy? And they could allow federating or not, right?
2021-02-11 12:53:06	Westernesse	Sure. ChapoChat, a very left-wing instance, is currently unfederated.
2021-02-11 12:59:42	fighters52	Is the a twitter-like service or a reddit-like service?
2021-02-11 12:59:54	Westernesse	ChapoChat runs on a fork of Lemmy
2021-02-11 13:00:22	Westernesse	It's the continuation of the controversial /r/ChapoTrapHouse subreddit.
2021-02-11 13:01:16	fighters52	Okay. That's kinda what I would want to do, except I would want to federate with other sites.
2021-02-11 13:01:38	fighters52	Is that what https://patriots.win runs on?
2021-02-11 13:03:14	Westernesse	I don't know what patriots.win runs on exactly, but it's probably not a Lemmy fork. And ChapoChat's lemmy fork is developed by and for the people running ChapoChat.
2021-02-11 13:09:08	fighters52	So this is more work than what an average non-programmer could do?
2021-02-11 13:10:20	Westernesse	I think you can likely just follow Lemmy's guide for installation and configuration. But deeper customization might be pretty advanced.
2021-02-11 13:10:27	Westernesse	I haven't looked into it myself.
2021-02-11 13:15:41	BillyHW	hi
2021-02-11 13:18:05	Westernesse	fighters52: Another issue is actually getting people to join, I suppose.
2021-02-11 13:18:05	Westernesse	You have competition from the two subreddits you mentioned (which don't really experience interference from Reddit admins afaik), but also from all the independent forums. Something like rcsocial.net actually provided something new. And without being certain of federation, you don't really have anything more to offer than those.
2021-02-11 13:19:36	fighters52	Reddit is taking a heavier hand than some realize. I'm a mod on there. Doing some independent investigation before bringing some ideas to the group.
2021-02-11 13:20:36	fighters52	My hope was to create an instance and federate and just stay on the down-low among others so that they do not automatically defederate.
2021-02-11 13:21:26	fighters52	I am not a big fan of the far right sites and don't want to just jump on one of their servers. I am traditional but do not like some of the stuff populated by other groups, even if I would not defederate from them.
2021-02-11 13:23:28	Westernesse	Yeah. You probably want strict moderation guidelines, written in a way that does not offend someone very left-wing. Rcsocial isn't on any major Mastodon blocklists for example, and only seems to be banned on specific instances out of kneejerk anti-religious sentiments.
2021-02-11 13:23:28	Westernesse	To avoid the latter, you could see if you can cast a wider net.
2021-02-11 13:24:49	luke-jr	fighters52: reddit banned me for saying self-defense is a right and gave pedos control of my subreddit
2021-02-11 13:27:17	BillyHW	Everyone is an unholy faggot these days.
2021-02-11 13:27:57	luke-jr	(violent pedos, ironically enough)
2021-02-11 13:29:05	Westernesse	fighters52: Once upon a time, I collaborated on a failed subreddit project: https://old.reddit.com/r/Postchristianity/
2021-02-11 13:29:05	Westernesse	Lofty language like the description in the sidebar might help with making a traditional religious project appear more palatable.
2021-02-11 13:29:06	ljrbot	Title: Countercultural christianity in a postchristian world (at old.reddit.com)
2021-02-11 13:30:22	fighters52	Interesting.
2021-02-11 13:31:18	fighters52	I once got grilled/interviewed by Reddit hosts. Wanting to know my specific opinion on homosexuality. I said something about predatory homosexuals deserving punishment. But they didn't ban me.
2021-02-11 13:31:35	fighters52	They did ban another mod.
2021-02-11 13:32:35	Westernesse	https://tradistae.com/ seems like it recasts neo-integralism as a radical project. Might also be interesting, language and presentation wise.
2021-02-11 13:32:36	ljrbot	Title: Tradistae Qui fideliter cuncta faciebant. (at tradistae.com)
2021-02-11 13:35:40	Westernesse	fighters52: Discussion about homosexuality among regular people doesn't really lead to new insights, and mostly serves to attract outside scrutiny (which a project aiming for federation likely wants to avoid). Then again, if you explicitly say not to discuss the topic, it might be seen as exclusionary. This is something that would require a subtle touch in a code of conduct / content policy.
