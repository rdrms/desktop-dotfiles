2018-08-30 22:01:03	rydare	looking for something portable yet hardy
2018-08-30 22:01:34	bkero	They are good
2018-08-30 22:02:14	bkero	Although are less portable by modern standards.
2018-08-30 22:04:08	rydare	hmm
2018-08-30 22:04:20	rydare	i saw an article about ARM laptops
2018-08-30 22:04:28	rydare	thought it was interesting
2018-08-30 22:05:19	rydare	but that's sort of off topic
2018-08-30 22:05:30	rydare	i think i will get a thinkpad
2018-08-30 22:06:17	rydare	is ebay the best place to get them

2018-08-30 22:06:21	rydare	or is there a better place
2018-08-30 22:06:36	bkero	ebay is likely the best place
2018-08-30 22:06:44	bkero	Unless you live in ta US metro are, then maybe craigslist
2018-08-30 22:06:48	bkero	area*

2018-08-30 22:10:06	VitoG	bkero i dunno where ill get my hp elitebook, i would do thinkpad a485 instead if they had a better screen
2018-08-30 22:10:24	VitoG	store likely will carry both
2018-08-30 22:11:00	VitoG	do a search on google products
2018-08-30 22:11:01	bkero	Do those A-series ThinkPads actually have a glass-filled polymer shell, or regular laptop plastic like in the 13?
2018-08-30 22:11:30	VitoG	uhmmm

2018-08-30 22:12:46	VitoG	im in usa so its cheapest to buy here
2018-08-30 22:12:48	bkero	Why would reputable authorized lenovo places sell a 5 year old laptop?
2018-08-30 22:12:49	VitoG	i guess
2018-08-30 22:12:59	VitoG	they sell refurbs
2018-08-30 22:13:05	VitoG	off lease
2018-08-30 22:13:09	rydare	newegg.ca has a "scratch and dent" refurb for $200
2018-08-30 22:13:15	rydare	the good ones are ~$400
2018-08-30 22:13:26	VitoG	newegg is good
2018-08-30 22:13:33	rydare	there's a guy offering a refurbished one with RAM and SSD for $475

2018-08-30 22:19:50	VitoG	hmm
2018-08-30 22:19:58	bkero	I wonder what elitebooks are made of
2018-08-30 22:20:45	micrex22	bkero: from the fingernails of HP employees? :p
2018-08-30 22:20:54	VitoG	elitebook is machined aluminum
2018-08-30 22:21:04	VitoG	thinkpad a is plastic
2018-08-30 22:21:08	bkero	The whole thing?
2018-08-30 22:21:14	VitoG	would rather the aluminum
2018-08-30 22:21:24	bkero	ThinkPads are plastic, but they're quite a good kind of plastic
2018-08-30 22:21:59	bkero	Glass-filled polymer means it still bends, but bends back without cracking or warping permanently
2018-08-30 22:22:18	VitoG	and is aluminum better or worse
2018-08-30 22:22:31	bkero	It's different. It has problems too.
2018-08-30 22:22:43	VitoG	i guess
2018-08-30 22:22:45	bkero	It can pit from the oils on your skin for example
2018-08-30 22:22:57	 *	bkero finds picture
2018-08-30 22:23:01	VitoG	i would think aluminum would be better
2018-08-30 22:23:20	bkero	It also usually has a finish on it, which isn't aluminum and rubs off looking ugly
2018-08-30 22:24:11	bkero	Here's an example of some light pitting: https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse3.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.XSST-Je6N1Ap9N9rFZiWswHaFj%26pid%3D15.1&f=1

2018-08-30 22:29:22	VitoG	same with california tho
2018-08-30 22:29:25	bkero	Safe, low crime, good transit, good night life, cheap

2018-08-30 22:29:44	VitoG	cheap computer parts

2018-08-30 22:31:42	VitoG	maybe a knockoff like huwei
2018-08-30 22:31:45	bkero	Typically brand-name crap in China is the same price if not a little more expensive than the US.
2018-08-30 22:31:53	VitoG	yeah
2018-08-30 22:31:55	bkero	The best deals are no-brands

2018-08-31 05:53:30	CerpinTaxt	Revenue - $1.370 billion (2017)

2018-08-31 05:55:11	CerpinTaxt	At least they've beefed up security. -_-
2018-08-31 05:55:28	demonicmaniac3	microsoft had certs compromised
2018-08-31 05:55:35	demonicmaniac3	meaning everybody could sign everything
2018-08-31 05:55:38	demonicmaniac3	so it's not like realtek is alone
2018-08-31 05:55:49	demonicmaniac3	hp had issues, dell had self signed root cert on the updater
2018-08-31 05:56:05	demonicmaniac3	name any company they all fucked up massively
2018-08-31 05:57:33	CerpinTaxt	It said they had to gain physical access to Realtek's HQ

2018-08-31 06:03:21	Ryccardo	not really ¨issues¨, just that they are not designed for 60, 30, or 10 hz
2018-08-31 06:03:24	CerpinTaxt	What are you doing with an e-ink display that needs a refresh rate faster than a book
2018-08-31 06:03:25	demonicmaniac3	you don't need refresh rates for reading text. they can do 24p
2018-08-31 06:03:42	CerpinTaxt	Can it run Crysis
2018-08-31 06:03:55	demonicmaniac3	so good enough for movies even though you don't want that anyway because even the color einks don't do more than 1000 colors
2018-08-31 06:03:59	user51	CerpinTaxt: Yes but only in ASCII mode

2018-08-31 06:04:32	demonicmaniac3	and resolution doesn't affect their switching speed
2018-08-31 06:04:34	user51	2200x1650 is the highest I've seen.
2018-08-31 06:04:44	demonicmaniac3	but eink is completely inefficient at high refresh rates
2018-08-31 06:04:53	demonicmaniac3	the point is not using energy while displaying a static image
2018-08-31 06:05:40	user51	Not sure how that works with web browsing or coding.

2018-08-31 06:06:24	demonicmaniac3	*isn't
2018-08-31 06:06:35	demonicmaniac3	and even then you don't exceed 5hz even as the fastest typist
2018-08-31 06:06:53	demonicmaniac3	and if you just pageturn or half page turn on websites there's also zero problem
2018-08-31 06:07:18	user51	Huh, I thought it was way worse.
2018-08-31 06:08:05	user51	Now we need a magician to connect a 570E to a UXGA e-ink
2018-08-31 06:09:26	demonicmaniac3	you do have to disable javascript obviously at least javascript animations or suppress them in the browser and limit css transform animation speeds or catch them in the browser and let them run at 5hz only or so
2018-08-31 06:09:50	demonicmaniac3	you can see how it works with that one chinese eink android phone where they changed the ui to not do scrolling animations or popups
