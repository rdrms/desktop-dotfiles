2018-08-22 11:21:47	mal	[09:59:48] how about removing the libwifi stuff from the spec
2018-08-22 11:21:47	mal	[09:59:54] it should have clear
2018-08-22 11:21:47	echo_salik	[10:00:38] ok...
2018-08-22 11:21:47	echo_salik	[10:02:08] mal the libwifi part is alreay commented...
2018-08-22 11:21:47	echo_salik	[10:02:23] with an # sign
2018-08-22 11:21:47	echo_salik	[10:12:02] i just redownloaded the spec file and removed the libwifi but same error
2018-08-22 11:21:47	vknecht	[10:28:32] echo_salik, what do your spec files look like now ?
2018-08-22 11:21:47	echo_salik	[10:41:21] vknecht: https://hastebin.com/nilurinija.http
2018-08-22 11:21:47	 *	echo_salik [10:59:37] sings: 99 little bugs in the code 99 little bugs... take one down patch it around... 127 little bugs in the code...
2018-08-22 11:21:47	mal	[11:02:39] echo_salik: I just did a clean build of that libhybris branch against aosp 8.1 base without any errors, unless lineageos base is in some way different
2018-08-22 11:21:47	mal	[11:04:04] echo_salik: how exactly did you clone it? like this "git clone https://github.com/krnlyng/libhybris-1.git -b android8-initial  --recurse-submodules"
2018-08-22 11:21:47	echo_salik	[11:09:36] mal: yep
2018-08-22 11:21:47	echo_salik	[11:09:45] exactly like that
2018-08-22 11:21:47	echo_salik	[11:11:43] do i have to use asop base?
2018-08-22 11:21:47	mal	[11:11:55] no, you can't use the same
2018-08-22 11:21:47	mal	[11:12:10] show the whole build log from the libhybris.log
2018-08-22 11:21:47	echo_salik	[11:12:26] in a moment

2018-08-22 11:21:47	mal	[11:15:02] how can that be if you have the libwifi commented out as it is by default in that branch
2018-08-22 11:21:47	mal	[11:16:06] what local changes have you done currently?
2018-08-22 11:21:47	mal	[11:16:08] run git diff
2018-08-22 11:21:47	mal	[11:16:43] this whole thing should have been trivial to fix, no idea how you manage to break the build
2018-08-22 11:21:47	echo_salik	[11:21:07] mal: as you said... we fail in mysterious ways...

2018-08-22 11:26:37	echo_salik	steps: downloaded spec from that link, deleted wifi listings
2018-08-22 11:28:38	mal	those changes make very little sense, you removed libvibrator?
2018-08-22 11:29:37	vknecht	echo_salik, what's the exact command you used ?
2018-08-22 11:30:55	echo_salik	mal: nope... but isnt that diff with respect to that hybris-l repo?
2018-08-22 11:31:17	echo_salik	vknecht: rpm/dhd/helpers/build_packages.sh -b hybris/mw/libhybris  my exact command
2018-08-22 11:33:00	mal	echo_salik: based on that git fif you did remove it
2018-08-22 11:33:05	mal	*git diff
2018-08-22 11:35:13	echo_salik	wait that's not the whole git diff
2018-08-22 11:36:04	echo_salik	my bad: https://hastebin.com/agerikicim.shell
2018-08-22 11:37:24	echo_salik	what i mean to say is this git diff is referring all the changes that the new spec that i downloaded has... the only changes i manually made are removing wifi so things
2018-08-22 11:38:12	echo_salik	i had not commited the libspec that i downloaded... so its showing those changes too
2018-08-22 11:38:38	echo_salik	i not good at conveying what i mean...
2018-08-22 11:39:12	mal	so why did you add libwifi back there manually, just look at your git diff
2018-08-22 11:39:40	mal	I give up, you are telling one thing but git diff says something completely different
2018-08-22 11:41:37	echo_salik	ok... what i'll do again is redownload that spec... commit it... then remove libwifi stuff then show you the git diff...
2018-08-22 11:43:01	mal	what the hell are you doing, LIBWIFI IS ALREADY REMOVED FROM THE DAMN SPEC
2018-08-22 11:43:34	mal	I'm not going to help anymore today, you have all the information you need, just fix it yourself
2018-08-22 11:47:40	r0kk3rz	echo_salik: you dont need to commit anything, it seems like you misunderstand a few git fundamentals
2018-08-22 11:47:47	echo_salik	mal: you gave me this file: https://github.com/mer-hybris/libhybris/blob/master/rpm/libhybris.spec, please look at line: 347
2018-08-22 11:48:38	mal	echo_salik: WE WERE TALKING ABOUT LIBNFC WHEN I GAVE YOU THAT
2018-08-22 11:48:39	echo_salik	r0kk3rz: mal gave me ^ link, it has libwifi.so uncommented
2018-08-22 11:48:49	mal	NOT LIBWIFI
2018-08-22 11:49:21	mal	there a thing called context, look it up from a dictionary
2018-08-22 11:50:03	echo_salik	mal you gave me that spec, i am using that spec... how the hell am i supposed to know you mean a different spec when you told me to use THAT spec!?
2018-08-22 11:51:19	mal	well with normal logic if your error was about libnfc then you search for things related to thatt from what I gave you, but that would require too much logic it seems
2018-08-22 11:53:20	mal	I even said to look for the things in the error from the spec
2018-08-22 11:54:02	mal	I will not comment anymore here because soon I will be kicked out for bad language
2018-08-22 11:55:37	echo_salik	i'll leave the chat sorry for everything

2018-08-22 13:00:57	mal	maybe I should just stay silent for a few weeks
2018-08-22 13:11:23	r0kk3rz	mal: just chill out, if people are frustrating you then ignore them
2018-08-22 13:11:46	r0kk3rz	i certainly do that some times, especially if i think they have all the information they need
2018-08-22 13:17:26	mal	I just get annoyed so easily nowaday so better I stop helping completely

2018-08-25 02:12:10	echo_salik	cool there is a wiki on it... didnt expect that...
2018-08-25 02:12:40	echo_salik	btw r0kk3rz pwoer button doesnt wake screen up
2018-08-25 02:12:43	echo_salik	*power
2018-08-25 02:13:51	r0kk3rz	maybe not then :)
2018-08-25 02:14:05	r0kk3rz	yeah mce is a core daemon that handles device state
2018-08-25 02:14:47	r0kk3rz	but as per usual, logz plz
2018-08-25 02:15:34	echo_salik	r0kk3rz: that's where it gets interesting... telent kicks me like 10 seconds after connectiong
2018-08-25 02:15:52	echo_salik	im never going to type telenet correctly...
2018-08-25 02:15:56	echo_salik	-.-
2018-08-25 02:19:38	r0kk3rz	tlerenet
2018-08-25 02:20:14	r0kk3rz	which telnet?
2018-08-25 02:20:32	echo_salik	telnet 192.168.2.15 2323
2018-08-25 02:20:39	r0kk3rz	ok, thats not so bad
2018-08-25 02:21:10	r0kk3rz	try to quickly dump journalctl
2018-08-25 02:21:23	echo_salik	also after getting kicked by telnet i cant even reconnect
2018-08-25 02:22:24	echo_salik	Q: is there a way to run a bash script x seconds after boot? like cron?
2018-08-25 02:23:14	echo_salik	if it has cron i can keep a script at root which makes the logs and i can get them from recovery?
2018-08-25 02:24:26	r0kk3rz	yeah
2018-08-25 02:24:45	echo_salik	it has cron?
2018-08-25 02:24:46	r0kk3rz	you can schedule whatever you like with a systemd service file
2018-08-25 02:24:59	echo_salik	oh systemd
2018-08-25 02:25:28	echo_salik	but to enable that i'd need to be connected to telent long enough...
2018-08-25 02:25:36	r0kk3rz	not exactly
2018-08-25 02:25:44	r0kk3rz	'enabling' is just creating a symlink
2018-08-25 02:26:00	echo_salik	oh yeah...
2018-08-25 02:26:10	echo_salik	i can do that with recovry i think
2018-08-25 02:26:14	echo_salik	*recovery
2018-08-25 02:26:23	echo_salik	but would it be a bad idea?
2018-08-25 02:28:05	r0kk3rz	seems ok, sometimes getting logs of misbehaving devices can be a pita
2018-08-25 02:28:08	r0kk3rz	*off
2018-08-25 02:28:56	r0kk3rz	for a while i added a line to my android init.rcs to dump logcat for the same reason
2018-08-25 02:29:27	elros1	yeah, better just take live logs: journalctl -f, dmesg. You can also enable persistent journal in /etc/systemd/journald.conf
2018-08-25 02:29:45	echo_salik	oh... cool... but i have now a stable telnet
2018-08-25 02:30:07	echo_salik	nope... got disconnected...
2018-08-25 02:30:12	echo_salik	but i have logs!

2018-08-25 02:42:04	r0kk3rz	thats a good idea, the first thing to tackle is why your telnet is breaking

2018-08-25 02:42:50	echo_salik	so how do i enable pstore...

2018-08-25 03:00:13	r0kk3rz	like that
2018-08-25 03:00:59	echo_salik	thanks
2018-08-25 03:01:02	r0kk3rz	so what will happen, is if you get kernel panics it will dump stuff to /sys/fs/pstore which we can use to figure out whats going on
2018-08-25 03:01:24	echo_salik	oh...
2018-08-25 03:01:59	echo_salik	so after this i'll just have to build boot img and recovery or everything?
2018-08-25 03:03:03	r0kk3rz	you can just flash the hybris-boot.img after hybris-hal build
2018-08-25 03:03:39	echo_salik	i have pstore enabled already...
2018-08-25 03:03:48	r0kk3rz	ok good
2018-08-25 03:03:57	echo_salik	sorry didnt knew that...
2018-08-25 03:04:02	echo_salik	*know that
2018-08-25 03:06:00	echo_salik	now... i'll read those contents after logging into telnet?
2018-08-25 03:08:47	echo_salik	r0kk3rz, i have nothing in my pstore
2018-08-25 03:14:06	elros1	it contains data only if kernel really crash
2018-08-25 03:19:40	echo_salik	so the kernel didnt crash... but i did get kicked out by telent again...
2018-08-25 03:20:24	echo_salik	so I nmap'ed the IP, the only open port is of ssh
2018-08-25 03:20:28	echo_salik	port 22
2018-08-25 03:20:49	r0kk3rz	hmm
2018-08-25 03:21:12	r0kk3rz	something is obviously crashing
2018-08-25 03:22:30	elros1	it can be some *.rc file which overwrites usb settings
2018-08-25 03:31:02	echo_salik	i remember adding some rc's for services and then adding and rc dpmd service to stop it

2018-08-25 04:11:42	echo_salik	_gnus_ it will be in the repos of the same gituser you used for your kernel and yes it will be in cm.dependencies i think

2018-08-26 04:24:24	r0kk3rz	but it seems like tbr needs ops to fix merbot
2018-08-26 04:24:58	tbr	or I fix its auth to services, haven't tried that in a year or two
2018-08-26 04:28:14	mal	tbr: I think it's common to have timing issues with auth, at least people using irssi have had such

2018-08-26 05:59:06	ghosalmartin	hmm if i build bootimage by it self it breaks, but it completes as part of hybris-boot...is there a chance hybris-boot is actually failing silently?
2018-08-26 06:01:47	ghosalmartin	mal: when you disabled selinux in system/core. did that stop the relience on libsepol?
2018-08-26 06:05:04	mal	ghosalmartin: are you sure you have the correct busybox, i.e. the prebuilt one used for android 8
2018-08-26 06:05:14	ghosalmartin	mal...no
2018-08-26 06:05:25	ghosalmartin	is that now required :P
2018-08-26 06:05:42	mal	ghosalmartin: check external/busybox to see which one you have
2018-08-26 06:06:10	mal	manifest has it correctly but not sure if your repo has been synced
2018-08-26 06:06:11	ghosalmartin	mal: 32bit one. i synced using the hybris-15.1 manifest?
2018-08-26 06:06:33	mal	so that points to mer-hybris/android_external_busybox_prebuilt ?
2018-08-26 06:06:45	mal	I mean the local copy
2018-08-26 06:06:58	ghosalmartin	mal: yes
2018-08-26 06:07:04	mal	ok
2018-08-26 06:07:20	ghosalmartin	am just trying to build a boot android kernel first
2018-08-26 06:10:27	ghosalmartin	mal: also theres some weird thing with the pixel phones that the recovery is in the same partition as boot
2018-08-26 06:11:02	mal	ghosalmartin: also some older sonys had recovery built into the kernel
2018-08-26 06:11:18	mal	not sure about newer sonys
2018-08-26 06:11:31	ghosalmartin	mal: hmm wonder why their moving to this kind of arch. it seemed much cleaner just having a separate partition
2018-08-26 06:12:30	ghosalmartin	could be that they want 2 boot partitions and 2 systems partitions for completely seamless OTA
2018-08-26 06:15:26	mal	ghosalmartin: sorry that I haven't made the test build yet for your device, I have some issues with disk space, I can only have out folder of one build at the time
2018-08-26 06:15:38	ghosalmartin	mal: its alright, this is a new device :P
2018-08-26 06:15:47	mal	oh, not the same annoying one
2018-08-26 06:16:01	ghosalmartin	pretty much :P its the Pixel Xl this time
2018-08-26 06:16:03	ghosalmartin	marlin
2018-08-26 06:16:38	mal	ok
2018-08-26 06:16:59	mal	wondering if I should rebase hybris-15.1
2018-08-26 06:20:25	ghosalmartin	think its outta date?
2018-08-26 06:21:28	mal	probably not too much but can't be sure, hybris-15.1 was based on r26 but lineage now uses r43 aosp as base
2018-08-26 06:21:55	ghosalmartin	mal: ahh i dont mind rebasing it, got some spare time today
2018-08-26 06:22:09	ghosalmartin	its complaining about some libsepol things when attempting a build, so could be relate
2018-08-26 06:22:30	mal	ghosalmartin: need to think how to handle that, a rebase or merge, rebase is cleaner probably
2018-08-26 06:23:07	ghosalmartin	rebase is always cleaner. i actively avoid merging nowadays unless others
2018-08-26 06:23:45	mal	ghosalmartin: for me the rebase is easier as I can just force push the branches :)
2018-08-26 06:24:42	ghosalmartin	there is that :P
2018-08-26 06:31:09	ghosalmartin	mal: what would be the easiest way to get the changes in? make them on a fork and get that taken in?
2018-08-26 06:32:20	mal	then it would be a merge
2018-08-26 06:33:13	ghosalmartin	like this https://github.com/mer-hybris/android_build/pull/10
2018-08-26 06:33:24	ghosalmartin	but isnt there a rebase option when selecting the merge?
2018-08-26 06:34:15	ghosalmartin	always been curious if that button actually doesnt anything useful
2018-08-26 06:40:18	ghosalmartin	yeah seems to work okay according to this quick test https://github.com/ghosalmartin/rebase_test/commits/master
2018-08-26 06:40:20	r0kk3rz	yeah there is, i think i tried it once
2018-08-26 06:43:27	ghosalmartin	it seems to work well. but am curious how itd work in a large team 8-10 people
2018-08-26 06:43:44	ghosalmartin	would we start to get some crazy conflicts coming in from it. am trying convert the team to rebasing...still :P
2018-08-26 06:44:38	ghosalmartin	also anyone know what happens if /boot isnt declared inside the fstab? do I just add an entry?

2018-08-26 06:56:30	ghosalmartin	i have a nice rebasing script that pulls in all the appropriate remotes, and pushes to mine after its done

2018-08-26 07:18:37	ghosalmartin	mal: before i open the prs, would using githubs rebase be a good way to handle the rebase to latest lineageos? if so all rebased and ready to merge
2018-08-26 07:18:41	ghosalmartin	or wanna test em first :P
2018-08-26 07:19:09	mal	I'll have a look and discuss with others
2018-08-26 07:19:45	ghosalmartin	okays :)
2018-08-26 07:21:18	ghosalmartin	btw the hybris-boot-part. is that actually required to boot to stage 1?
2018-08-26 07:21:41	mal	which one?
2018-08-26 07:23:22	ghosalmartin	when building hybris boot its searching for /boot. is that required to get to telnet. or is that only for systemd?
2018-08-26 07:23:31	ghosalmartin	this error ./hybris/hybris-boot/Android.mk:71: error: There should be a one and only one device entry for HYBRIS_BOOT_PART and HYBRIS_DATA_PART.
2018-08-26 07:23:58	ghosalmartin	HYBRIS_BOOT_PART doesnt have a /boot in the fstab for whatever reason
2018-08-26 07:24:56	mal	on one device I added /dev/null as /boot in fstab https://github.com/mlehtima/android_device_semc_msm7x30-common/commit/e1a57373b370ae7c4a3bc4541c09e751c567f6da
2018-08-26 07:26:21	ghosalmartin	that looks perfect ta :)

2018-08-26 07:41:33	ghosalmartin	woop woop :D
2018-08-26 07:42:34	mal	nice
2018-08-26 07:42:57	ghosalmartin	shame hte same didnt work with the mi mix 2, but ah well
2018-08-26 07:43:05	ghosalmartin	although it might be worth a shot, they both use the same hybris-15.1 codebase
