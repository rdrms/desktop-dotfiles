2018-08-29 14:29:21	AlienSoldier	Stppi created it, he just followed on it
2018-08-29 14:30:28	AlienSoldier	i think basic app need to be native, a browser by now is a basic app an OS can't do without
2018-08-29 14:32:16	AlienSoldier	who know in 20 year we might not even use browser anymore the same way we no longer use gophers
2018-08-29 14:33:11	AlienSoldier	web page are just the transposition of magazine page, kids do not read magazine anymore, so they might invent something else
2018-08-29 14:34:44	AlienSoldier	sometime i think we should have a very basic light fast browser and have server proxy that make the conversion.
2018-08-29 14:35:00	AlienSoldier	so all the haiku side would be slim
2018-08-29 14:35:42	AlienSoldier	and as the number of user is not that great, the windows computer making the convertion would not lag

2018-08-29 14:36:41	@mmu_man	Electron app… oh it uses v86.js which emulates kind of Pentium1
2018-08-29 14:36:49	@mmu_man	anyone tried booting Haiku? :D
2018-08-29 14:38:40	AlienSoldier	I was expecting an Acorn Electron
2018-08-29 14:39:00	@mmu_man	lol
2018-08-29 14:39:45	miqlas	AlienSoldier: there are proxies like that for old computer wit unsupported encryption ciphers.
2018-08-29 14:40:05	miqlas	they serving full-page gif images
2018-08-29 14:41:22	AlienSoldier	miqlas i guess it could use more advanced but still primitive structure.  I remember not so long ago Sony toyed with videogame "streaming"
2018-08-29 14:41:55	AlienSoldier	lag would kill me but for a browser i would not mind
2018-08-29 14:42:08	@waddlesplash	PulkoMandy: October 23?! what?
2018-08-29 14:42:22	@waddlesplash	last year and before it started early December or November
2018-08-29 14:43:14	AlienSoldier	first rain in a month, i should retard my tent and camel purchase.

2018-08-29 14:43:45	miqlas	AlienSoldier: the problem is: thoose proxies cannot handle dropdown menus, and user input and things. So while it would be ok for some use cases, it wouldn't be good for general webbrowsing.
2018-08-29 14:44:31	AlienSoldier	that is why i say it need some primitive.  At least the main cruft behing the interface would be gone.
2018-08-29 14:44:38	AlienSoldier	*behind
2018-08-29 14:45:21	miqlas	You can just install Netsurf
2018-08-29 14:45:44	AlienSoldier	i did :)
2018-08-29 14:46:14	AlienSoldier	but who should i call to ge the internet to obey to netsurf limitation
2018-08-29 14:46:29	AlienSoldier	those web developer broke the internet
2018-08-29 14:47:05	AlienSoldier	from now on they should be paid in Venezuelian money if they extend anything
2018-08-29 14:48:19	miqlas	AlienSoldier: install that proxy, i assume it can even work on Haiku, and set it up in netsurf (i assume it can handle proxies)
2018-08-29 14:48:28	AlienSoldier	the engine being separate of the data is what is not working for browsers

2018-08-29 14:58:21	@mmu_man	well, once a year
2018-08-29 14:58:40	DepositePirate	Gopher is still used btw, and it's steadily getting more users for some years now cause people are fed up with how capitalism ruined to web.

2018-08-29 15:00:22	@waddlesplash	HTTP/2, there may be an argument there, but still
2018-08-29 15:00:52	DepositePirate	the gopher protocol is so simple it makes it real hard to start building a whole stack on top of it

2018-08-30 08:18:29	@humdinger	and how would I kno about that? :)
2018-08-30 08:18:50	Begas_VBox	well thought you had some knowlidge about it :)
2018-08-30 08:18:51	@humdinger	sounds like it
2018-08-30 08:18:57	@humdinger	not me.
2018-08-30 08:19:16	Begas_VBox	libcddb is also looking for libcdio (but only for the test iirc)
2018-08-30 08:19:30	Begas_VBox	which fails for libcddb btw
2018-08-30 08:20:06	@humdinger	you need input from our haikuports sages

2018-08-30 08:33:20	Begas_VBox	probably won't solve the realpath test but would add to the package ..

2018-08-30 19:53:19	@waddlesplash	no?
2018-08-30 19:53:36	cb88	well there's only 2 files or am I missing something...
2018-08-30 19:53:42	@waddlesplash	yes, that's the whole driver?
2018-08-30 19:54:02	cb88	that doesn't seem right at all
2018-08-30 19:54:06	@waddlesplash	why?
2018-08-30 19:54:15	cb88	granted they merged the drivers in freebsd 12
2018-08-30 19:54:17	@waddlesplash	iwn is only 4 files, bwi is only 3 files, ...
2018-08-30 19:54:21	cb88	hmm
2018-08-30 19:54:26	@waddlesplash	yes, they merged all 3 driver variants in 12
2018-08-30 19:54:36	@waddlesplash	rtwn, urtwn, and ... whatever the 3rd one was (sdio?)
2018-08-30 19:54:41	@waddlesplash	we have just rtwn (PCI)

2018-08-30 19:57:32	@waddlesplash	but they probably split files up I guess
2018-08-30 19:57:43	cb88	yes exactly... 
2018-08-30 19:57:55	cb88	the main driver is 2k now but supports more stuff also
2018-08-30 19:58:25	cb88	they unified all the other realtek drivers under this one
2018-08-30 19:58:54	cb88	I'm looking at the freebsd 11.2 branch now and it looks like Haiku's
2018-08-30 20:00:43	@waddlesplash	probably because this is from 11.1? :p

2018-08-30 20:03:43	cb88	waddlesplash: is freebsd 12+ compat going to be a huge deal just curious?
2018-08-30 20:04:05	@waddlesplash	afaik they didn't change a massive amount of stuff in 12 for net80211
2018-08-30 20:04:21	@waddlesplash	however, I don't know if we presently support multiple drv interfaces per driver
2018-08-30 20:04:31	@waddlesplash	that might be an issue, but probably a few days' problem at most
2018-08-30 20:04:32	cb88	interesting... so maybe stripping out usb pcmica etc.. from the 12 driver would have it working also... hmm
2018-08-30 20:04:59	@waddlesplash	oh, no, it looks like we do, the ipro1000 driver does this
2018-08-30 20:05:00	@waddlesplash	nvm
2018-08-30 20:06:08	cb88	So, I guess the unsupported buses etc.. just would get ignored?
2018-08-30 20:06:18	@waddlesplash	for now, yes
2018-08-30 20:06:26	@waddlesplash	these expose a drv interface of their own, so, we can ignore them
2018-08-30 20:06:46	@waddlesplash	I did start a branch to add USB support (I have some Realtek USB WiFi dongles here), but, you know, beta
2018-08-30 20:08:03	cb88	sure that will be nice once that's working though, I'd rather have mesa though lol.... probably a bigger chunk to bit off though.

2018-08-30 20:19:56	cb88	isn't it possible to just build a driver and load it on the current installation?
2018-08-30 20:20:09	@waddlesplash	it is indeed
2018-08-30 20:20:19	@waddlesplash	just drop it into the appropriate non packaged directory
2018-08-30 20:20:35	@waddlesplash	and if it's a network device, you may need to kill net_server so it gets restarted and finds the new interface
2018-08-30 20:20:41	@waddlesplash	... of course it may just KDL immediately

2018-08-31 11:15:52	Vidrep	We need to make it easier for people to register and login using Vision
2018-08-31 11:16:36	Vidrep	I created a ticket for it a while ago. Some +1's for the idea
2018-08-31 11:16:55	@leorize	the problem is that there aren't any universal interface for registering on IRC AFAIK
2018-08-31 11:17:03	@humdinger	fin a dev that dares to touch Vision.

2018-08-31 11:18:15	@PulkoMandy	well, if we really want to fix this we should leave IRC and use something else, probably XMPP
2018-08-31 11:18:39	Scarecrow	don't hear people advocating XMPP often
2018-08-31 11:18:44	Vidrep	Janus was daring enough to adapt Vision to layout
2018-08-31 11:18:45	Scarecrow	so the Vision codebase ain't so nice?
2018-08-31 11:18:47	@PulkoMandy	(because we're going to stick with open source solutions and things that allow people < 16 year old to connect - some projects use Slack and had trouble with GCI)
2018-08-31 11:19:23	@leorize	not having to register is the biggest perks of IRC tbh
2018-08-31 11:19:29	@PulkoMandy	Scarecrow: for me it's still in the "would be nice" category. We need a serious client on Haiku first
2018-08-31 11:19:42	@PulkoMandy	leorize: creating an XMPP account is a 3 click process

2018-08-31 11:20:06	Scarecrow	XMPP is in a bizarre situation where the mobile clients are arguably much better than the desktop ones
2018-08-31 11:20:37	@PulkoMandy	not that unheard of these days
2018-08-31 11:20:43	Scarecrow	Pidgin may have a lot of features but it's also janky as hell compared to Conversations or Xabber
2018-08-31 11:20:49	@PulkoMandy	Android is a very lively place with thousand of apps for everything
2018-08-31 11:20:57	Scarecrow	For a 15-year-old protocol though?
2018-08-31 11:21:09	@leorize	because desktop people use bitlbee and never leave their IRC window lol
2018-08-31 11:21:09	Scarecrow	That stands out to me :p
2018-08-31 11:21:25	@PulkoMandy	there is this running joke about "finally the year of Linux on the Desktop" around here
2018-08-31 11:21:35	@PulkoMandy	they still don't get it, after all those years
2018-08-31 11:22:21	@PulkoMandy	there are quite interesting projects around XMPP
2018-08-31 11:22:21	Scarecrow	2015 or so was the year of the linux personal device, I'm not sure we'll ever see a year of the linux desktop
2018-08-31 11:22:38	@PulkoMandy	Cocconella was nice, and I should have a look at Movim (building a social network website over XMPP=
2018-08-31 11:22:53	@leorize	and now there's this matrix thingy
2018-08-31 11:23:01	@PulkoMandy	If I still believed in Linux on the Desktop I would not be working on Haiku
2018-08-31 11:23:37	Scarecrow	I'm not sure how to feel about Matrix, on one hand, it's very webby, on the other, it's the only real competition to something like Discord and Slack as far as features go.
2018-08-31 11:24:18	@PulkoMandy	there's Zulip as well, but I tried it last year (they decided to use it for the GSoC mentor summit and did not find it very enjoyable
2018-08-31 11:24:39	@PulkoMandy	I really think building a real good XMPP client for Haiku would be the right thing to do
2018-08-31 11:24:48	@PulkoMandy	but someone has to write the code
2018-08-31 11:25:00	@PulkoMandy	and my attempts at putting GCI tasks for that did not work out very well so far
2018-08-31 11:25:10	@PulkoMandy	maybe I should attempt it as a GSoC idea…
2018-08-31 11:25:35	Scarecrow	if I were more capable with C(++) I'd give it a go but I am not.

2018-08-31 16:23:53	@waddlesplash	it uses /dev/misc/poke
2018-08-31 16:24:01	@waddlesplash	that's how you access PCI/ISA on Haiku from userland
2018-08-31 16:25:14	@waddlesplash	mmu_man: well, please post it somewhere :p
2018-08-31 16:29:38	@mmu_man	hmm, IIRC that was about the PCI config space access, I think that's what still broken
2018-08-31 16:29:44	@mmu_man	does poke expose this yet?
2018-08-31 16:31:00	@mmu_man	it'd be better if it wasn't done manually from userland (as it looses atomicity which can confuse the bridge if a driver also uses config space)
2018-08-31 16:33:30	@mmu_man	the config space is accessed directly through the bridge, using indexed IO
2018-08-31 16:33:40	@mmu_man	if it's not kept atomic it can be a problem
2018-08-31 16:33:54	@mmu_man	so I'd rather just expose them through new ioctls on poke
2018-08-31 16:34:04	@mmu_man	I wonder if I started writing this or not
2018-08-31 16:34:21	@mmu_man	memory has bad blocks :)

2018-08-31 16:38:59	@mmu_man	I recall thinking there was an issue somewhere with this, but what exactly…
2018-08-31 16:39:38	@mmu_man	oh, at least one issue is it uses userland struct without checks :D
2018-08-31 16:39:43	@mmu_man	but well, like most drivers
