2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:02:32] i'll try with other soft i need this weekend
2018-08-22 11:21:47	@PulkoMandy	[10:02:46] leorize: can you make a patch? as I can't test 64bit :(
2018-08-22 11:21:47	Vidrep	[10:04:21] Once we create a Beta branch, will there be any test images created or do we continue as usual?
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:04:38] what info do you need from the log?
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:07:05] can send  you as text file
2018-08-22 11:21:47	leorize	[10:11:15] roiredX: all of it :P
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:11:42] I can't paste it here, I have it on a file
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:11:58] I mean, the outcome of "haikuporter godot"
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:12:00] ;)
2018-08-22 11:21:47	leorize	[10:12:23] I figured out what's wrong with `hp godot` :P
2018-08-22 11:21:47	leorize	[10:12:33] PulkoMandy: I can't test one rn :(
2018-08-22 11:21:47	leorize	[10:13:44] roiredX: we typically paste them to a pastebin then share the url here
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:14:14] well, as I am a bit ignorant, I am going to dare to ask, what is a pastebin?
2018-08-22 11:21:47	@PulkoMandy	[10:14:17] no hurry, but we should upstream the changes if possible
2018-08-22 11:21:47	@PulkoMandy	[10:14:30] roiredX: http://paste.debian.net for example
2018-08-22 11:21:47	 *	humdinger [10:14:36] plugs Clipdinger shamelessly
2018-08-22 11:21:47	@PulkoMandy	[10:14:40] it's a website where you can share text with others
2018-08-22 11:21:47	@PulkoMandy	[10:14:58] and right, Clipdinger on Haiku makes this super easy
2018-08-22 11:21:47	@humdinger	[10:15:02] PulkoMandy: you figured out the webkit build failure yet?
2018-08-22 11:21:47	@PulkoMandy	[10:15:29] yes, testing a fix but it takes a full rebuild of course :)
2018-08-22 11:21:47	@humdinger	[10:15:56] hours go by... :)
2018-08-22 11:21:47	@humdinger	[10:17:50] let's eat
2018-08-22 11:21:47	 *	humdinger [10:17:52] is idle: dinner
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:19:26] haikuporter godot <outcome> -> http://paste.debian.net/1038898/
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:19:52] anyway, not in a hurry, as PulkoMandy said
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:37:15] by the way, USBaudio is not yet supported, right?
2018-08-22 11:21:47	Begasus	[10:42:12] sh: g++-x86: command not found ... that's you're blocker
2018-08-22 11:21:47	Begasus	[10:43:32] not familiar with the source, does it use a configure.ac file?
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:44:18] no idea Begasus, just started today using haikuporter
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:44:25] and did not check that
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:44:52] right now I'm trying to get Musescore through haikuporter
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:44:55] and so far, so good
2018-08-22 11:21:47	Begasus	[10:45:01] if I check something new I usualy start out with checking the source in Terminal (not with haikuporter)
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:45:06] plenty of warnings
2018-08-22 11:21:47	Begasus	[10:45:19] wouldn't be the first :)
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:45:58] yep, I've got a tasklist.... long... XD
2018-08-22 11:21:47	leorize	[10:47:45] Begasus: look at the link I gave PulkoMandy above
2018-08-22 11:21:47	Begasus	[10:48:03] yeah saw it :)
2018-08-22 11:21:47	leorize	[10:48:43] You could rip off the code from x11/detect.py to replace it :P
2018-08-22 11:21:47	@PulkoMandy	[10:49:02] roiredX: we have a driver for usb audio, but it only works if you have OHCI USB ports (some specific PCI to USB1 cards only)
2018-08-22 11:21:47	Begas_VBox	[10:49:05] configure: error: 'autoconf-archive' missing
2018-08-22 11:21:47	Begas_VBox	[10:49:14] this is a new one to me ... 
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:49:41] I see PulkoMandy, that is why my hardware does not work
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:49:43] :D
2018-08-22 11:21:47	leorize	[10:49:55] Begas_VBox: I guess, uh, autoreconf it ;)
2018-08-22 11:21:47	Begas_VBox	[10:50:10] been there leorize :)
2018-08-22 11:21:47	Begas_VBox	[10:50:38] autoreconf: running: automake --add-missing --copy --force-missing
2018-08-22 11:21:47	Begas_VBox	[10:52:34] checking if autogen.sh does something to it .. 
2018-08-22 11:21:47	Begas_VBox	[10:55:31] nope ... 
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[11:01:10] take care, bye

2018-08-22 11:42:34	@humdinger	Vidrep!
2018-08-22 11:45:03	Vidrep	Been reading a bit about clipdinger. Never tried it, but now I may do so
2018-08-22 11:45:37	@humdinger	cool. someone reading up on an app first! :)
2018-08-22 11:45:44	Vidrep	The interesting part was that you can paste code easily 
2018-08-22 11:45:46	@humdinger	you're a unique guy... :)
2018-08-22 11:46:01	@humdinger	yep. the uploading is handy
2018-08-22 11:46:13	Vidrep	Does that mean it is preset to paste to a specific url?
2018-08-22 11:46:20	@humdinger	yes.
2018-08-22 11:46:46	@humdinger	making it  configurable wouldn't be easy for the regular user
2018-08-22 11:46:53	Vidrep	Sounds like an app I need to have
2018-08-22 11:47:05	@humdinger	You sure do!
2018-08-22 11:47:14	@humdinger	and it's very cheap, too!
2018-08-22 11:47:47	Vidrep	Accepting donations are you? lol
2018-08-22 11:48:03	@humdinger	nah.

2018-08-22 11:48:11	+Not-e85f	[haiku/webkit] pulkomandy bef4dfe - Make JavaScriptCore a shared library again.
2018-08-22 11:48:51	Vidrep	Earlier I asked how the Beta testing process was going to function. Does anyone know yet?
2018-08-22 11:50:00	@PulkoMandy	we still don't really have a QA team
2018-08-22 11:50:11	@PulkoMandy	get in touch with DCatt and start organizing things if you want
2018-08-22 11:50:28	@humdinger	But there'll be test images from the build bots according to waddlesplash's blog
2018-08-22 11:50:33	@PulkoMandy	tell us what you need to do good testing
2018-08-22 11:51:23	Vidrep	First, is having something that isn't going to change by the hour
2018-08-22 11:53:39	Vidrep	I'm probably going to be laid off from work as soon as the project we're working on is complete. Then I'll have planty of time on my hands to help out.
2018-08-22 11:54:15	Vidrep	Mid-September-ish
2018-08-22 11:54:45	@humdinger	bit late for the published beta-timeline
2018-08-22 11:55:05	@humdinger	try to get fired sooner...
2018-08-22 11:55:26	Vidrep	There are thousands of bug reports in trac, but many of them were reported on hrevs from years ago
2018-08-22 11:56:18	Vidrep	I'd think creating bug reports on a fixed build that doesn't change all the time
2018-08-22 11:57:05	@humdinger	not sure with what frequency the RCs will be released
2018-08-22 11:57:22	Vidrep	i.e. a bug reporting system for the beta branch
2018-08-22 11:57:29	@humdinger	seems like only two weeks are set aside for that.
2018-08-22 11:57:46	Vidrep	Way too optimistic
2018-08-22 11:58:09	@PulkoMandy	well, if you had bug to reports, you shoud have done it earlier :)
2018-08-22 11:58:18	@humdinger	there will probably be a tag for beta tickets
2018-08-22 11:58:34	Vidrep	I have a ton already - take your pick :)
2018-08-22 11:58:41	@PulkoMandy	there is a "version" field for this already

2018-08-22 11:59:00	@PulkoMandy	people just forgot about it since no one would dare to report a bug from alpha4 nowadays ;)
2018-08-22 11:59:12	@humdinger	PulkoMandy: yes, but the Beta/1 entry is missing atm
2018-08-22 11:59:23	@PulkoMandy	yes, we don't have an image yet
2018-08-22 11:59:31	@PulkoMandy	we will add it as we start shipping images
2018-08-22 12:00:32	@humdinger	with two weeks RC testing time, I guess there won't be more that 2 or three RC images built.
2018-08-22 12:01:10	@humdinger	BTW, I still have to blacklist xhci or my mouse will die after a while... nothing in syslog.
2018-08-22 12:01:15	@humdinger	too bad.
2018-08-22 12:02:28	@humdinger	Will there be a forum thread for e.g. the intel_extreme hardware that doesn't work? To get the IDs that need to be cut from the driver.

2018-08-23 08:35:29	Vidrep	I saw some comment in the forum (I think) about the first test image being ready for this Saturday. True or not?
2018-08-23 08:36:43	@humdinger	doubt it. we haven't branched yet...
2018-08-23 08:37:13	Vidrep	First things first...
2018-08-23 08:37:39	Vidrep	Question: How to use libroot_debug?
2018-08-23 08:37:56	leorize	LD_PRELOAD=libroot_debug.so <your program here>
2018-08-23 08:38:08	Vidrep	Piece of cake
2018-08-23 08:38:14	Vidrep	Thanks leorize 
2018-08-23 08:39:29	Vidrep	leorize: did I see somewhere that you're leaving us soon?
2018-08-23 08:39:44	leorize	no?
2018-08-23 08:39:55	leorize	I'm not leaving anytime soon
2018-08-23 08:40:33	@humdinger	Vidrep has a new job at the rumour mill... :)
2018-08-23 08:40:41	Vidrep	lol
2018-08-23 08:41:21	Vidrep	I thought I read somewhere that you were writing exams or going back to school
2018-08-23 08:41:31	Vidrep	Maybe someone else?
2018-08-23 08:41:41	leorize	I'm writing exam report rn :P
2018-08-23 08:42:17	leorize	currently uni is quite lax, I still have plenty of time to work on ports
2018-08-23 08:42:38	leorize	I do have to postpone work when exams show up however
2018-08-23 08:44:00	leorize	after the 28th I should be back with porting :)
2018-08-23 08:44:18	@humdinger	Sept. ?
2018-08-23 08:44:32	leorize	August
2018-08-23 08:44:41	@humdinger	oh! 2018?
2018-08-23 08:44:50	leorize	my uni life started since July :(
2018-08-23 08:45:31	@humdinger	it'll get worse. after uni, jobs lurk...

2018-08-23 09:09:27	@humdinger	Iron Maiden "Killers" was my 1st album IIRC.
2018-08-23 09:09:58	@humdinger	kept hearing it end-to-end for hours at a time while playing Paradroid with a friend.
2018-08-23 09:10:33	Vidrep	My first album...hmmmm...Black sabbath Vol. 4
2018-08-23 09:10:38	@humdinger	still my favorite album
2018-08-23 09:10:59	@humdinger	sabbath... hmmmm 
2018-08-23 09:11:21	@humdinger	(^ that's a Homer "hmmm")
2018-08-23 09:12:36	@humdinger	sadly, the latest web+ didn't fix the to me most annoying bugs.
2018-08-23 09:12:41	Vidrep	As a kid my friends and I were into Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, ZZ Top, Uriah Heep, Alice Cooper etc
2018-08-23 09:13:18	@humdinger	Yeah. ZZtop! the first 3 or 4 albums.

2018-08-23 09:36:45	@humdinger	Any idea where these come from: KERN: acquire_advisory_lock(vnode = 0xd604cc30, flock = 0xcceb7efc, wait = no)
2018-08-23 09:36:56	Vidrep	What's strange is that it just quits, without any debugger prompt or option to save a debug report
2018-08-23 09:36:57	@humdinger	I see them quite often lately in the syslog
2018-08-23 09:37:32	Vidrep	humdinger: I see them too
2018-08-23 09:38:00	@PulkoMandy	Vidrep: according to your syslog, I think debug_server does not manage to attach
2018-08-23 09:38:19	@PulkoMandy	which is possible if memory is really badly corrupt, enough to prevent starting the debug thread, I think
2018-08-23 09:38:26	Vidrep	So, is that a debugger issue?
2018-08-23 09:39:56	Vidrep	I'm working off of a fresh install with only a couple of pkgman updates
2018-08-23 09:41:02	@PulkoMandy	it's more a flaw in the design of our debugging system
2018-08-23 09:41:15	@PulkoMandy	basically, debugger needs to run code inside the application it's debugging
2018-08-23 09:41:27	@PulkoMandy	this can only work if the application is not too much corrupt, of course
2018-08-23 09:42:09	@PulkoMandy	a better approach would be to do everything using code running outside the application, but it would need more collaboration from the kernel (because one app is not allowed to peek at another's memory, even if the app is Debugger)
2018-08-23 09:43:55	leorize	basically adding ptrace support?

2018-08-23 12:18:27	@waddlesplash	sambagirl: from scratch indeed
2018-08-23 12:19:20	janus2	waddlesplash, PulkoMandy did you know why a directory is missing from the installation even if is present in the iso=?
2018-08-23 12:19:56	@PulkoMandy	the installer skips some things on purpose. And it may have bugs
2018-08-23 12:20:29	janus2	I just look into the code and the parent directory is present in the copyengine
2018-08-23 12:20:55	janus2	all the siblings are present
2018-08-23 12:20:58	@waddlesplash	PulkoMandy: your most recent commit seems to have some unrelated changes
2018-08-23 12:21:06	@PulkoMandy	yes, I saw that :(
2018-08-23 12:21:14	@waddlesplash	PulkoMandy: the new traces look ok but the net80211 one should get reverted
2018-08-23 12:21:22	@waddlesplash	11N debug is probably pretty spammy

2018-08-23 14:07:06	ngc	shift was the way to go
2018-08-23 14:07:25	ngc	that's kind of a cool feature :-)
2018-08-23 14:10:17	Vidrep	When you break things as often as we do, it's a VERY cool feature :)
2018-08-23 14:10:50	Vidrep	Hopefully, soon, we won't be using this feature so often
2018-08-23 14:12:27	Vidrep	PulkoMandy: I haven't tested yet, but does the new webkit fix the issue with not being able to attach documents in GitHub?

2018-08-23 14:28:22	ngc	[14:18:30] so my findings are that with the version from may the ar9285 works from power on until the first reboot. with the current version a sadly can not get it to work.
2018-08-23 14:28:22	ngc	[14:19:34] the driver seems to be loaded but can not enumerate the wifi networks
2018-08-23 14:28:22	ngc	[14:21:01] luckily the marvel yukon ethernet driver seems to work. in the past that was a little bit unstable.

2018-08-23 21:10:19	AlienSoldier	does it in any text entry box here
2018-08-23 21:14:31	IIsi50MHz	Works with these settings. LCD subpixel causes cursor position mismatch. Glyph off with greyscale causes irregular spacing.

2018-08-24 09:49:44	@humdinger	grr... I missed that one...
2018-08-24 09:50:19	Vidrep	It seems redundant
2018-08-24 09:50:43	Vidrep	Two "Reporting" headers with the same link?
2018-08-24 09:53:38	@humdinger	Every item on that page has three sub-items: the problem, mitigation and reporting. so it's OK I think.
2018-08-24 09:54:36	leorize	roiredX: we have gfortran I think
2018-08-24 09:54:42	leorize	try pkgman install cmd:gfortran
2018-08-24 09:54:56	roiredX	yes... i did
2018-08-24 09:54:57	roiredX	;)
2018-08-24 09:55:08	roiredX	pkgman is nice
2018-08-24 09:55:17	roiredX	though I am more used to apt
2018-08-24 09:55:58	roiredX	:D
2018-08-24 09:56:47	@PulkoMandy	apt doesn't handle cmd: and the like. What were they thinking? And it's the third attempt at improving the package CLI at Debian :/

2018-08-24 09:57:02	roiredX	XD
2018-08-24 09:57:38	roiredX	well, actually I find pkgman easy, though there is no manpage
2018-08-24 09:57:44	roiredX	;)
2018-08-24 09:58:02	leorize	Arch's pacman decided to solve everything with -F :p
2018-08-24 09:59:49	roiredX	when I used Gentoo back in the days I "loved" the "emerge" thing
2018-08-24 09:59:57	roiredX	emerge this and that
2018-08-24 09:59:59	roiredX	XD
2018-08-24 10:00:08	@PulkoMandy	we don't do much manpages. Most commands have a --help however
2018-08-24 10:00:29	roiredX	well, I never tried that with pkgman XD
2018-08-24 10:00:37	roiredX	is the heat
2018-08-24 10:00:47	@PulkoMandy	I find that the Terminal is an unsuitable place to read docs. I would prefer "man foo" to open a web browser (as "git help" does for example)
2018-08-24 10:01:13	@PulkoMandy	well, I'm used to --help and often on Linux I face an unhelpful result
2018-08-24 10:01:20	roiredX	heat breaks my guitars' strings as well as my braincells
2018-08-24 10:01:23	roiredX	:D
2018-08-24 10:01:27	@PulkoMandy	like, a list of 1 letter flags I can enable, but no description of what they do
2018-08-24 10:01:36	roiredX	agree on that one

2018-08-24 10:01:58	roiredX	many times there is not a 1 letter flag that does what you need to do
2018-08-24 10:02:23	Vidrep	PulkoMandy: were the libroot_debug logs of any use to you (web+)?
2018-08-24 10:02:55	@PulkoMandy	maybe, I did look while at work but didn't have time to dig into it yet
2018-08-24 10:02:58	@PulkoMandy	after dinner :)
2018-08-24 10:03:12	Vidrep	Just curious
2018-08-24 10:03:24	@PulkoMandy	quite possibly I fixed an earlier crash and now it crashes a few lines later in a different way…
2018-08-24 10:03:35	Vidrep	I really haven't had time to check if any other sites cause issues
2018-08-24 10:03:57	leorize	I think one letter flags are designed for a "consistent" feel between CLI apps
2018-08-24 10:04:04	Vidrep	Will review my open tickets with new webkit this weekend
2018-08-24 10:04:10	leorize	it worked great until that flag don't do what you expect :)

2018-08-24 11:01:34	Scarecrow	can I use bitmapped fonts?
2018-08-24 11:02:20	roiredX	why would you want to use bitmapped fonts?
2018-08-24 11:02:34	Scarecrow	I like SGI Screen 9px for terminals
2018-08-24 11:02:57	roiredX	I presume you can search for a freetype or truetype or opentype equivalent
2018-08-24 11:03:11	Scarecrow	on a tiny low-res screen a bitmapped font is a lot nicer than a scalable one
2018-08-24 11:03:27	roiredX	I see... :)
2018-08-24 11:03:46	Scarecrow	this laptop has a 10" 1024x576 screen
2018-08-24 11:03:52	roiredX	wow
2018-08-24 11:04:02	roiredX	that is tiny
2018-08-24 11:04:10	Scarecrow	yeah man it's also half as powerful as the desktop I was using in 2005
2018-08-24 11:04:20	Scarecrow	it's terrible
2018-08-24 11:04:22	Scarecrow	I love it
2018-08-24 11:04:27	roiredX	XD
2018-08-24 11:04:48	Scarecrow	I'll try terminus_ttf
2018-08-24 11:05:44	Scarecrow	does not work as well as bitmapped fonts at small sizes
2018-08-24 11:05:58	Scarecrow	skinny and blurred
2018-08-24 11:06:14	roiredX	you could try some sort of bitmapped ttf
2018-08-24 11:06:20	roiredX	there are some available
2018-08-24 11:06:27	roiredX	if i recall correctly
2018-08-24 11:07:31	roiredX	for terminal I also like larabiefont
2018-08-24 11:07:42	roiredX	but that is not what i meant before
2018-08-24 11:08:21	Scarecrow	I'll see if this TTF conversion works

2018-08-24 11:10:03	roiredX	maybe is what you need

2018-08-24 12:01:34	✴️	IIsi50MHz [11:29:29] tries to remember
2018-08-24 12:01:34	IIsi50MHz	[11:30:34] Consolas? No, maybe not. I'll have to check when I get home.
2018-08-24 12:01:34	IIsi50MHz	[11:31:12] I, too, am a fan of typefaces easily readable at small font sizes.
2018-08-24 12:01:34	Scarecrow	[11:31:58] Settled on Fira Mono for now
2018-08-24 12:01:34	Scarecrow	[11:32:10] I used it before I discovered SGI Screen
2018-08-24 12:01:34	Scarecrow	[11:32:22] I can't believe I used this laptop for two years for actual work
2018-08-24 12:01:34	Scarecrow	[11:32:27] LaTeX and Blender and stuff
2018-08-24 12:01:34	IIsi50MHz	[11:35:05] Vaio B100B at home for Haiku. Sadly, its the 1024×768 version instead of 1280×1024.
2018-08-24 12:01:34	IIsi50MHz	[11:35:21] "#largepixels" (-:
2018-08-24 12:01:34	@PulkoMandy	[11:44:01] we have one bitmap font actually. The one we use for KDL
2018-08-24 12:01:34	@PulkoMandy	[11:44:22] we used to have a second one that worked in app_server
2018-08-24 12:01:34	@PulkoMandy	[11:44:30] not sure which format should be used however
2018-08-24 12:01:34	Scarecrow	[11:44:34] Not the bitmap font you want to see, eh?
2018-08-24 12:01:34	@PulkoMandy	[11:45:08] well, KDL is a thousand times more helpful than window's blue screen or Linux "let's just blink the keyboard leds"

2018-08-24 12:01:34	@PulkoMandy	[11:45:33] but right, userland feels safer and cosier :>
2018-08-24 12:01:34	Scarecrow	[11:45:55] It's *usually* not what you want to see
2018-08-24 12:01:34	@PulkoMandy	[11:49:17] Vidrep: should I close https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/13267 and track the new problem in https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/14385
2018-08-24 12:01:34	✴️	PulkoMandy [11:49:27] wonders how the same website can trigger so many different crashes
2018-08-24 12:01:34	Vidrep	[11:53:01] PulkoMandy: makes sense to do so, especially if its the same website and we're testing a newer webkit build
2018-08-24 12:01:34	@PulkoMandy	[11:53:34] it doesn't crash for me so far
2018-08-24 12:01:34	@PulkoMandy	[11:53:42] I see graphics glitches however
2018-08-24 12:01:34	Vidrep	[11:53:45] So, 13267 would then become a blocker?
2018-08-24 12:01:34	Vidrep	[11:54:12] I was testing on 64 bit. It crashes 100% of the time
2018-08-24 12:01:34	Vidrep	[11:56:02] There's a handful of websites (like Yahoo News) that give Web+ problems. 
2018-08-24 12:01:34	@PulkoMandy	[11:56:40] seems stable on 32bit. That's progress, in past versions it always crashed
2018-08-24 12:01:34	@PulkoMandy	[11:56:56] but the graphics glitches look worrying, I should look into that
2018-08-24 12:01:34	Vidrep	[11:57:40] Kijiji also crashes Web+, but I haven't tested yet with new webkit. Usually it takes a few minutes of navigating the ads to cause a crash
2018-08-24 12:01:34	@PulkoMandy	[12:00:43] ok, I manage to crash it by hovering the mouse over the first news items
2018-08-24 12:01:34	@PulkoMandy	[12:00:49] but scrolling down the page is ok

2018-08-25 00:22:14	Begas_VBox	not sure it would contribute something for Haiku?
2018-08-25 00:22:42	leorize	we should only package it once some programs around need it
2018-08-25 00:25:09	Begas_VBox	latest gobject-introspection source is calling for it

2018-08-25 10:11:25	allowh	there is now an ACPI problem!

2018-08-25 10:14:36	@humdinger	sure. but with no info, fixing is quite impossible
2018-08-25 10:15:14	allowh	humdinger I think the problem was that developpers changed something it was working, or they where fixing something for some machines and create a bug for others!

2018-08-25 10:34:32	@waddlesplash	...
2018-08-25 10:34:38	Scarecrow	that's a new one
2018-08-25 10:35:42	cull	Is this a freenode problem or specific to #haiku?
2018-08-25 10:37:22	@humdinger	freenode is overrun
2018-08-25 10:37:55	cull	That sucks.
2018-08-25 10:38:30	@humdinger	up until yesterday we only allowed registered users in the channel because of that.
2018-08-25 10:38:37	@humdinger	we may have to go back to that.
2018-08-25 10:40:08	cull	Ever think about moving to Rizon or something?
2018-08-25 10:41:10	@humdinger	Not me. I like IRC in general, esp. using Vision in Haiku.
2018-08-25 10:41:21	@waddlesplash	ok I think I'll add the q flag
2018-08-25 10:41:25	@waddlesplash	that will ban non registered users from speaking
2018-08-25 10:41:25	@waddlesplash	but it will still allow registered users to talk
2018-08-25 10:41:43	Maylay	that's probably a better idea
2018-08-25 10:41:49	leorize	humdinger: you might want to deop if you don't like the spam :P
2018-08-25 10:41:49	cull	Oh humdinger  rizon is an irc network
2018-08-25 10:41:57	Maylay	kind of annoying getting bumped to an unreged channel
2018-08-25 10:42:03	@humdinger	waddlesplash: will those be informed why they are muted and how to register a nick?
2018-08-25 10:42:35	leorize	unfortunately no, unless we have a bot to tell them
2018-08-25 10:42:42	@humdinger	cull: I see.... dunno
2018-08-25 10:43:02	leorize	waddlesplash: add +z so mods can see unregistered users

2018-08-25 10:43:19	@humdinger	let me eat on it.
2018-08-25 10:43:22	✴️	humdinger is idle: dinner
2018-08-25 10:43:33	cull	I mean there are other IRC networks I guess is my point but if freenode works than it works
2018-08-25 10:43:48	Maylay	rizon gets spammed occasinally too
2018-08-25 10:43:56	cull	True.
2018-08-25 10:44:10	leorize	it's a problem with the nature IRC in general
2018-08-25 10:45:50	Maylay	IRC is 30 years old today
2018-08-25 10:46:12	Maylay	I think we have enough tools made in that time to deal with spammers

2018-08-26 00:00:49	leorize	it's fine to merge master to the branch, a squash merge will solve it :)
2018-08-26 00:01:14	Begasus	so it should be ok so far? then I'll leave it

2018-08-26 00:06:45	miqlas	oh, the haiku bug wich i haven't reported yet is solved somewhere along the recent commits.
2018-08-26 00:06:48	miqlas	Nice.

2018-08-26 00:08:36	leorize	waddlesplash: forgot to ask, what is the "new software policy" of the beta branch?
2018-08-26 00:08:44	leorize	can I just add more softwares?
2018-08-26 00:09:07	miqlas	It was basically this: i have workspaces replicant on the desktop, and i use the mouse scroll to change worspaces. Haiku was able to change between the workspaces buttersmooth if there were no open windows. If one desktop had any window, during the switch the desktop icons blinked. I assume there were a complete desktop redraw or something like that.
2018-08-26 00:09:14	miqlas	It seems to be solved now.
2018-08-26 00:10:34	miqlas	i sometimes just sit before the computer and scrolling trough my workspaces and watch how does the screen content changes. That's how i noticed it.
2018-08-26 00:11:00	miqlas	yep, seems to be solved, my icons are steady.

2018-08-26 06:23:57	arfonzo	How do I upgrade/switch from my nightly (using the .../current Haiku and HaikuPorts repo paths) to the beta RC?
2018-08-26 06:24:39	Begas_VBox_64	I gues running "pkgman full-sync" should keep you on par

2018-08-26 07:20:17	@waddlesplash	but it also will not really be different from master
2018-08-26 07:21:54	arfonzo	cool, thanks waddlesplash. It would be good to know exactly how end users can test the beta RC branch, including migrate/upgrade/prefer to install fresh, that kind of thing. Great work everyone!

2018-08-26 07:50:16	Begasus	just wondering why on the other laptop Haiku boots perfecly with the USB stick, after install it keeps hanging on the last icon ...

2018-08-26 08:34:09	Begas_VBox	never used it (yet) :)
2018-08-26 08:36:08	leorize	miqlas: since in the future an user can either install a package in the global scope or local scope

2018-08-26 08:48:23	miqlas	[08:36:18] Begas_VBox: the cmake fFindSoemthing.cmake files were a pain in the butt as they cannot find the header and/or the libs. Somebody pointed i can actually pass theese variables to cmake, and since then i use $portPackageLinksDir extensively.
2018-08-26 08:48:23	miqlas	[08:37:31] for an example: cmake complains LIBXY_INCLUDE_DIR is undefined. I nthis case you can add -DLIBXY_INCLUDE_DIR="here_comes_the_path", so you don't have to fix all the FindXY.cmake files.
2018-08-26 08:48:23	miqlas	[08:37:38] nice thing if you asks me.
2018-08-26 08:48:23	Begas_VBox	[08:42:50] still not a big fan of cmake here :)
2018-08-26 08:48:23	Begas_VBox	[08:43:01] and glad to! :D
2018-08-26 08:48:23	leorize	[08:43:08] I like meson more :P
2018-08-26 08:48:23	Begas_VBox	[08:44:01] first time was for the proto files here leorize, so not really knowlidge about it :)
2018-08-26 08:48:23	miqlas	[08:45:38] i'm actually a firend of every build systems, but i don't like the mess waht auto* can make
2018-08-26 08:48:23	leorize	[08:46:08] don't worry, everyone hate auto*hell
2018-08-26 08:48:23	miqlas	[08:46:34] if you try to reconfigure something old, you will have a hard time with aclocal, autoreconf, automake, autopoint, autoidontknowwhatelse
2018-08-26 08:48:23	leorize	[08:47:40] autoreconf was definitely their attempt to make life easier
2018-08-26 08:48:23	miqlas	[08:47:50] technically it isn't bad, but the fact, that it is a really big bash script wich depend on bash, but i nthe same time on defined version of auto*, that makes my life sometimes pretty hard.
2018-08-26 08:48:23	leorize	[08:47:52] that's until you hit the cases where autoreconf wouldn't work
2018-08-26 08:48:23	miqlas	[08:48:18] If i get AC_SOMETHING needs to be defined, i just delete the complete source folder and start to drink.
