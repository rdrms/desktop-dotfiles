2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:02:32] i'll try with other soft i need this weekend
2018-08-22 11:21:47	@PulkoMandy	[10:02:46] leorize: can you make a patch? as I can't test 64bit :(
2018-08-22 11:21:47	Vidrep	[10:04:21] Once we create a Beta branch, will there be any test images created or do we continue as usual?
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:04:38] what info do you need from the log?
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:07:05] can send  you as text file
2018-08-22 11:21:47	leorize	[10:11:15] roiredX: all of it :P
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:11:42] I can't paste it here, I have it on a file
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:11:58] I mean, the outcome of "haikuporter godot"
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:12:00] ;)
2018-08-22 11:21:47	leorize	[10:12:23] I figured out what's wrong with `hp godot` :P
2018-08-22 11:21:47	leorize	[10:12:33] PulkoMandy: I can't test one rn :(
2018-08-22 11:21:47	leorize	[10:13:44] roiredX: we typically paste them to a pastebin then share the url here
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:14:14] well, as I am a bit ignorant, I am going to dare to ask, what is a pastebin?
2018-08-22 11:21:47	@PulkoMandy	[10:14:17] no hurry, but we should upstream the changes if possible
2018-08-22 11:21:47	@PulkoMandy	[10:14:30] roiredX: http://paste.debian.net for example
2018-08-22 11:21:47	 *	humdinger [10:14:36] plugs Clipdinger shamelessly
2018-08-22 11:21:47	@PulkoMandy	[10:14:40] it's a website where you can share text with others
2018-08-22 11:21:47	@PulkoMandy	[10:14:58] and right, Clipdinger on Haiku makes this super easy
2018-08-22 11:21:47	@humdinger	[10:15:02] PulkoMandy: you figured out the webkit build failure yet?
2018-08-22 11:21:47	@PulkoMandy	[10:15:29] yes, testing a fix but it takes a full rebuild of course :)
2018-08-22 11:21:47	@humdinger	[10:15:56] hours go by... :)
2018-08-22 11:21:47	@humdinger	[10:17:50] let's eat
2018-08-22 11:21:47	 *	humdinger [10:17:52] is idle: dinner
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:19:26] haikuporter godot <outcome> -> http://paste.debian.net/1038898/
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:19:52] anyway, not in a hurry, as PulkoMandy said
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:37:15] by the way, USBaudio is not yet supported, right?
2018-08-22 11:21:47	Begasus	[10:42:12] sh: g++-x86: command not found ... that's you're blocker
2018-08-22 11:21:47	Begasus	[10:43:32] not familiar with the source, does it use a configure.ac file?
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:44:18] no idea Begasus, just started today using haikuporter
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:44:25] and did not check that
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:44:52] right now I'm trying to get Musescore through haikuporter
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:44:55] and so far, so good
2018-08-22 11:21:47	Begasus	[10:45:01] if I check something new I usualy start out with checking the source in Terminal (not with haikuporter)
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:45:06] plenty of warnings
2018-08-22 11:21:47	Begasus	[10:45:19] wouldn't be the first :)
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:45:58] yep, I've got a tasklist.... long... XD
2018-08-22 11:21:47	leorize	[10:47:45] Begasus: look at the link I gave PulkoMandy above
2018-08-22 11:21:47	Begasus	[10:48:03] yeah saw it :)
2018-08-22 11:21:47	leorize	[10:48:43] You could rip off the code from x11/detect.py to replace it :P
2018-08-22 11:21:47	@PulkoMandy	[10:49:02] roiredX: we have a driver for usb audio, but it only works if you have OHCI USB ports (some specific PCI to USB1 cards only)
2018-08-22 11:21:47	Begas_VBox	[10:49:05] configure: error: 'autoconf-archive' missing
2018-08-22 11:21:47	Begas_VBox	[10:49:14] this is a new one to me ... 
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:49:41] I see PulkoMandy, that is why my hardware does not work
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[10:49:43] :D
2018-08-22 11:21:47	leorize	[10:49:55] Begas_VBox: I guess, uh, autoreconf it ;)
2018-08-22 11:21:47	Begas_VBox	[10:50:10] been there leorize :)
2018-08-22 11:21:47	Begas_VBox	[10:50:38] autoreconf: running: automake --add-missing --copy --force-missing
2018-08-22 11:21:47	Begas_VBox	[10:52:34] checking if autogen.sh does something to it .. 
2018-08-22 11:21:47	Begas_VBox	[10:55:31] nope ... 
2018-08-22 11:21:47	roiredX	[11:01:10] take care, bye

2018-08-22 11:42:34	@humdinger	Vidrep!
2018-08-22 11:45:03	Vidrep	Been reading a bit about clipdinger. Never tried it, but now I may do so
2018-08-22 11:45:37	@humdinger	cool. someone reading up on an app first! :)
2018-08-22 11:45:44	Vidrep	The interesting part was that you can paste code easily 
2018-08-22 11:45:46	@humdinger	you're a unique guy... :)
2018-08-22 11:46:01	@humdinger	yep. the uploading is handy
2018-08-22 11:46:13	Vidrep	Does that mean it is preset to paste to a specific url?
2018-08-22 11:46:20	@humdinger	yes.
2018-08-22 11:46:46	@humdinger	making it  configurable wouldn't be easy for the regular user
2018-08-22 11:46:53	Vidrep	Sounds like an app I need to have
2018-08-22 11:47:05	@humdinger	You sure do!
2018-08-22 11:47:14	@humdinger	and it's very cheap, too!
2018-08-22 11:47:47	Vidrep	Accepting donations are you? lol
2018-08-22 11:48:03	@humdinger	nah.

2018-08-22 11:48:11	+Not-e85f	[haiku/webkit] pulkomandy bef4dfe - Make JavaScriptCore a shared library again.
2018-08-22 11:48:51	Vidrep	Earlier I asked how the Beta testing process was going to function. Does anyone know yet?
2018-08-22 11:50:00	@PulkoMandy	we still don't really have a QA team
2018-08-22 11:50:11	@PulkoMandy	get in touch with DCatt and start organizing things if you want
2018-08-22 11:50:28	@humdinger	But there'll be test images from the build bots according to waddlesplash's blog
2018-08-22 11:50:33	@PulkoMandy	tell us what you need to do good testing
2018-08-22 11:51:23	Vidrep	First, is having something that isn't going to change by the hour
2018-08-22 11:53:39	Vidrep	I'm probably going to be laid off from work as soon as the project we're working on is complete. Then I'll have planty of time on my hands to help out.
2018-08-22 11:54:15	Vidrep	Mid-September-ish
2018-08-22 11:54:45	@humdinger	bit late for the published beta-timeline
2018-08-22 11:55:05	@humdinger	try to get fired sooner...
2018-08-22 11:55:26	Vidrep	There are thousands of bug reports in trac, but many of them were reported on hrevs from years ago
2018-08-22 11:56:18	Vidrep	I'd think creating bug reports on a fixed build that doesn't change all the time
2018-08-22 11:57:05	@humdinger	not sure with what frequency the RCs will be released
2018-08-22 11:57:22	Vidrep	i.e. a bug reporting system for the beta branch
2018-08-22 11:57:29	@humdinger	seems like only two weeks are set aside for that.
2018-08-22 11:57:46	Vidrep	Way too optimistic
2018-08-22 11:58:09	@PulkoMandy	well, if you had bug to reports, you shoud have done it earlier :)
2018-08-22 11:58:18	@humdinger	there will probably be a tag for beta tickets
2018-08-22 11:58:34	Vidrep	I have a ton already - take your pick :)
2018-08-22 11:58:41	@PulkoMandy	there is a "version" field for this already

2018-08-22 11:59:00	@PulkoMandy	people just forgot about it since no one would dare to report a bug from alpha4 nowadays ;)
2018-08-22 11:59:12	@humdinger	PulkoMandy: yes, but the Beta/1 entry is missing atm
2018-08-22 11:59:23	@PulkoMandy	yes, we don't have an image yet
2018-08-22 11:59:31	@PulkoMandy	we will add it as we start shipping images
2018-08-22 12:00:32	@humdinger	with two weeks RC testing time, I guess there won't be more that 2 or three RC images built.
2018-08-22 12:01:10	@humdinger	BTW, I still have to blacklist xhci or my mouse will die after a while... nothing in syslog.
2018-08-22 12:01:15	@humdinger	too bad.
2018-08-22 12:02:28	@humdinger	Will there be a forum thread for e.g. the intel_extreme hardware that doesn't work? To get the IDs that need to be cut from the driver.

2018-08-23 08:36:43	@humdinger	doubt it. we haven't branched yet...
2018-08-23 08:37:13	Vidrep	First things first...

2018-08-23 08:41:31	Vidrep	Maybe someone else?
2018-08-23 08:41:41	leorize	I'm writing exam report rn :P

2018-08-23 08:42:38	leorize	I do have to postpone work when exams show up however
2018-08-23 08:44:00	leorize	after the 28th I should be back with porting :)
2018-08-23 08:44:18	@humdinger	Sept. ?

2018-08-23 09:09:58	@humdinger	kept hearing it end-to-end for hours at a time while playing Paradroid with a friend.
2018-08-23 09:10:33	Vidrep	My first album...hmmmm...Black sabbath Vol. 4
2018-08-23 09:10:38	@humdinger	still my favorite album

2018-08-23 09:12:36	@humdinger	sadly, the latest web+ didn't fix the to me most annoying bugs.
2018-08-23 09:12:41	Vidrep	As a kid my friends and I were into Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, ZZ Top, Uriah Heep, Alice Cooper etc
2018-08-23 09:13:18	@humdinger	Yeah. ZZtop! the first 3 or 4 albums.

2018-08-23 09:36:45	@humdinger	Any idea where these come from: KERN: acquire_advisory_lock(vnode = 0xd604cc30, flock = 0xcceb7efc, wait = no)
2018-08-23 09:36:56	Vidrep	What's strange is that it just quits, without any debugger prompt or option to save a debug report
2018-08-23 09:36:57	@humdinger	I see them quite often lately in the syslog
2018-08-23 09:37:32	Vidrep	humdinger: I see them too
2018-08-23 09:38:00	@PulkoMandy	Vidrep: according to your syslog, I think debug_server does not manage to attach
2018-08-23 09:38:19	@PulkoMandy	which is possible if memory is really badly corrupt, enough to prevent starting the debug thread, I think
2018-08-23 09:38:26	Vidrep	So, is that a debugger issue?
2018-08-23 09:39:56	Vidrep	I'm working off of a fresh install with only a couple of pkgman updates
2018-08-23 09:41:02	@PulkoMandy	it's more a flaw in the design of our debugging system
2018-08-23 09:41:15	@PulkoMandy	basically, debugger needs to run code inside the application it's debugging
2018-08-23 09:41:27	@PulkoMandy	this can only work if the application is not too much corrupt, of course
2018-08-23 09:42:09	@PulkoMandy	a better approach would be to do everything using code running outside the application, but it would need more collaboration from the kernel (because one app is not allowed to peek at another's memory, even if the app is Debugger)
2018-08-23 09:43:55	leorize	basically adding ptrace support?

2018-08-23 12:19:56	@PulkoMandy	the installer skips some things on purpose. And it may have bugs
2018-08-23 12:20:29	janus2	I just look into the code and the parent directory is present in the copyengine

2018-08-23 13:51:35	ngc	I don't know the exact version I am coming from, but have not updated the installation for a few months before.

2018-08-23 13:57:53	@Diver	it's most likely a regression
2018-08-23 13:58:37	miqlas	ngc: have you tried to cold boot?
2018-08-23 13:59:11	ngc	version before seems to be from may 25

2018-08-23 14:02:17	ngc	cold boot sadly has not resolved the issue. is there a way to boot into the state before the upgrade to double check?
2018-08-23 14:03:24	Vidrep	ngc: hit space bar during boot (before icons)
2018-08-23 14:03:26	miqlas	hols space at boot
2018-08-23 14:03:59	miqlas	space doesn't works well with some computers.
2018-08-23 14:04:01	miqlas	test both
2018-08-23 14:04:52	Vidrep	If you have Haiku BootManager installed, hit Shift+Enter

2018-08-23 14:28:22	ngc	[14:18:30] so my findings are that with the version from may the ar9285 works from power on until the first reboot. with the current version a sadly can not get it to work.
2018-08-23 14:28:22	ngc	[14:19:34] the driver seems to be loaded but can not enumerate the wifi networks
2018-08-23 14:28:22	ngc	[14:21:01] luckily the marvel yukon ethernet driver seems to work. in the past that was a little bit unstable.

2018-08-24 09:48:12	roiredX	is there any fortran compiler available?
2018-08-24 09:48:31	roiredX	this afternoon is 100% Haiku devoted
2018-08-24 09:49:26	Vidrep	The first link works now, but the second one at the bottom under "reporting" is still dead
2018-08-24 09:49:44	@humdinger	grr... I missed that one...
2018-08-24 09:50:19	Vidrep	It seems redundant
2018-08-24 09:50:43	Vidrep	Two "Reporting" headers with the same link?
2018-08-24 09:53:38	@humdinger	Every item on that page has three sub-items: the problem, mitigation and reporting. so it's OK I think.
2018-08-24 09:54:36	leorize	roiredX: we have gfortran I think
2018-08-24 09:54:42	leorize	try pkgman install cmd:gfortran

2018-08-24 10:00:37	roiredX	is the heat
2018-08-24 10:00:47	@PulkoMandy	I find that the Terminal is an unsuitable place to read docs. I would prefer "man foo" to open a web browser (as "git help" does for example)
2018-08-24 10:01:13	@PulkoMandy	well, I'm used to --help and often on Linux I face an unhelpful result

2018-08-24 10:03:12	Vidrep	Just curious
2018-08-24 10:03:24	@PulkoMandy	quite possibly I fixed an earlier crash and now it crashes a few lines later in a different wayâ¦
2018-08-24 10:03:35	Vidrep	I really haven't had time to check if any other sites cause issues
2018-08-24 10:03:57	leorize	I think one letter flags are designed for a "consistent" feel between CLI apps
2018-08-24 10:04:04	Vidrep	Will review my open tickets with new webkit this weekend

2018-08-24 12:01:34	Vidrep	[11:53:45] So, 13267 would then become a blocker?

2018-08-25 10:10:49	allowh	when I shutdown haiku os on aspire one it shows a blank screen
2018-08-25 10:11:09	allowh	if I reset it shows a black screen and doesn't shutdown!!!
2018-08-25 10:11:25	@humdinger	allowh: sounds like a acpi issue.
2018-08-25 10:11:25	allowh	there is now an ACPI problem!
2018-08-25 10:11:33	@humdinger	see
2018-08-25 10:11:42	allowh	ya, but it was working some months ago!
2018-08-25 10:11:55	Vidrep_gcc2h	I have a Dell desktop that stopped shutting down recently too
2018-08-25 10:12:22	allowh	I think developpers made mistakes changing ACPI code :)
2018-08-25 10:12:47	Begasus_	leorize, will look into your latest comments :)
2018-08-25 10:13:07	@humdinger	apparently. you could binary search the commit that broke it for you.
2018-08-25 10:13:25	@humdinger	maybe provide the syslogs of it working/not-working.
2018-08-25 10:13:46	allowh	humdinger is not only for me, it isn't working in other machines that have ACPI
2018-08-25 10:14:00	allowh	humdinger it will be hard to do that
2018-08-25 10:14:34	Vidrep_gcc2h	allowh, does it behave like this? https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/14205
2018-08-25 10:14:36	@humdinger	sure. but with no info, fixing is quite impossible
2018-08-25 10:15:14	allowh	humdinger I think the problem was that developpers changed something it was working, or they where fixing something for some machines and create a bug for others!
2018-08-25 10:15:37	@humdinger	obviously.
2018-08-25 10:15:57	leorize	I think tqh would be interested in your ACPI problems
2018-08-25 10:16:02	Vidrep_gcc2h	Problem was narrowed down (for me) to between hrev52009 - 52012
2018-08-25 10:16:28	allowh	Vidrep_gcc2h well, shutdown -r doesn't reboot
2018-08-25 10:16:49	Vidrep_gcc2h	Mine reboots OK, just won't shut down

2018-08-25 10:19:21	allowh	but without this fix, should not have a main release, this is a serious issue.
2018-08-25 10:20:54	allowh	to have a release all bugs that doesn't allow people to access desktop, wifi and use internet, and reboot, shutdown, they all should be fixed

2018-08-25 10:22:16	@humdinger	yeah, we should halt beta until all bugs are fixed.
2018-08-25 10:22:35	allowh	ACPI should be marked as yellow on the ticket list ;)
2018-08-25 10:23:35	@humdinger	there are many hardware related tickets that can only be fixed if a dev is found that has time, motivation and the same hardware.
2018-08-25 10:23:55	@humdinger	a rare combination.
2018-08-25 10:24:16	@humdinger	we'll have to live with Haiku not running optmall on every piece of hardware

2018-08-25 10:37:55	cull	That sucks.
2018-08-25 10:38:30	@humdinger	up until yesterday we only allowed registered users in the channel because of that.
2018-08-25 10:38:37	@humdinger	we may have to go back to that.
2018-08-25 10:40:08	cull	Ever think about moving to Rizon or something?
2018-08-25 10:41:10	@humdinger	Not me. I like IRC in general, esp. using Vision in Haiku.

2018-08-25 10:41:25	@waddlesplash	that will ban non registered users from speaking

2018-08-25 08:43:56	@waddlesplash	[13:40:09] what ticket?
2018-08-25 08:43:56	cb88	[13:41:57] It's a one liner so I just pasted the line in the ticket.. I put it just below the 0x9806 line https://dev.haiku-os.org/ticket/14379
2018-08-25 08:43:56	cb88	[13:42:43] And as I said in the ticket.. VGA and HDMI don't work (don't think they work with Vesa either so it's not like I lost anything).
2018-08-25 08:43:56	@waddlesplash	[13:43:30] they would not indeed

2018-08-26 00:06:45	miqlas	oh, the haiku bug wich i haven't reported yet is solved somewhere along the recent commits.
2018-08-26 00:06:48	miqlas	Nice.

2018-08-26 00:08:36	leorize	waddlesplash: forgot to ask, what is the "new software policy" of the beta branch?
2018-08-26 00:08:44	leorize	can I just add more softwares?
2018-08-26 00:09:07	miqlas	It was basically this: i have workspaces replicant on the desktop, and i use the mouse scroll to change worspaces. Haiku was able to change between the workspaces buttersmooth if there were no open windows. If one desktop had any window, during the switch the desktop icons blinked. I assume there were a complete desktop redraw or something like that.
2018-08-26 00:09:14	miqlas	It seems to be solved now.
2018-08-26 00:10:34	miqlas	i sometimes just sit before the computer and scrolling trough my workspaces and watch how does the screen content changes. That's how i noticed it.
2018-08-26 00:11:00	miqlas	yep, seems to be solved, my icons are steady.

2018-08-26 08:48:23	miqlas	[08:36:18] Begas_VBox: the cmake fFindSoemthing.cmake files were a pain in the butt as they cannot find the header and/or the libs. Somebody pointed i can actually pass theese variables to cmake, and since then i use $portPackageLinksDir extensively.
2018-08-26 08:48:23	miqlas	[08:37:31] for an example: cmake complains LIBXY_INCLUDE_DIR is undefined. I nthis case you can add -DLIBXY_INCLUDE_DIR="here_comes_the_path", so you don't have to fix all the FindXY.cmake files.
2018-08-26 08:48:23	miqlas	[08:37:38] nice thing if you asks me.

2018-08-26 08:48:23	miqlas	[08:46:34] if you try to reconfigure something old, you will have a hard time with aclocal, autoreconf, automake, autopoint, autoidontknowwhatelse
2018-08-26 08:48:23	leorize	[08:47:40] autoreconf was definitely their attempt to make life easier
2018-08-26 08:48:23	miqlas	[08:47:50] technically it isn't bad, but the fact, that it is a really big bash script wich depend on bash, but i nthe same time on defined version of auto*, that makes my life sometimes pretty hard.
2018-08-26 08:48:23	leorize	[08:47:52] that's until you hit the cases where autoreconf wouldn't work
2018-08-26 08:48:23	miqlas	[08:48:18] If i get AC_SOMETHING needs to be defined, i just delete the complete source folder and start to drink.
