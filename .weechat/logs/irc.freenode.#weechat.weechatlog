2018-08-22 11:21:47	squigzy	[10:29:52] bin_bash: You can make a PR or issue https://github.com/weechat/weechat.org

2018-08-22 11:21:47	squigzy	[10:32:14] sure seems that way https://plop.pw/ACPm0D8Ymcv63yiydnEZhIs97EHr.png
2018-08-22 11:21:47	bin_bash	[10:32:58] squigzy: this repo is for the weechat software.
2018-08-22 11:21:47	sim642	[10:33:58] FAQ source is actually in the main repo, not the .org one
2018-08-22 11:21:47	chainsol	[10:34:15] The .org repo is the website, not the FAQ, but it's a Django site.
2018-08-22 11:21:47	bin_bash	[10:34:21] for updating the HTML?
2018-08-22 11:21:47	bin_bash	[10:34:31] oh it's all generated we
2018-08-22 11:21:47	sim642	[10:34:31] the HTML is built from asciidoc
2018-08-22 11:21:47	bin_bash	[10:34:32] ew*
2018-08-22 11:21:47	chainsol	[10:35:05] What is the change you're suggesting?
2018-08-22 11:21:47	squigzy	[10:35:38] sim642: well that's silly.
2018-08-22 11:21:47	sim642	[10:35:51] Silly?
2018-08-22 11:21:47	squigzy	[10:35:53] bin_bash: welcome to 2018
2018-08-22 11:21:47	int3l	[10:36:04] #Welcome
2018-08-22 11:21:47	sim642	[10:36:08] the faq and other docs are bundled in some package too for local offline viewing
2018-08-22 11:21:47	bin_bash	[10:36:14] re-structure the FAQ so that when searching via a search engine you can link to the appropriate section
2018-08-22 11:21:47	bin_bash	[10:36:18] but actually im lookinmg now
2018-08-22 11:21:47	chainsol	[10:36:22] ah
2018-08-22 11:21:47	squigzy	[10:36:23] sim642: I guess that's fair
2018-08-22 11:21:47	chainsol	[10:36:25] that's a good suggestion
2018-08-22 11:21:47	sim642	[10:36:32] Aren't there anchors already?
2018-08-22 11:21:47	bin_bash	[10:36:36] and it seems that google does that
2018-08-22 11:21:47	bin_bash	[10:36:46] yeah idk what happened yesterday mustve been somethiung janky on my machine
2018-08-22 11:21:47	chainsol	[10:36:48] well, it's already solved, then!
2018-08-22 11:21:47	bin_bash	[10:37:08] i was looking for the delay thing and only had the faq and i guess the sidebar didnt load properly or something
2018-08-22 11:21:47	bin_bash	[10:37:12] lolol suggestion implemented!
2018-08-22 11:21:47	bin_bash	[10:37:13] :D
2018-08-22 11:21:47	Gagis	[10:37:19] the best kind of issue is the one that magically solves itself
2018-08-22 11:21:47	bin_bash	[10:37:30] exactly. and not that it was even really a "problem"
2018-08-22 11:21:47	bin_bash	[10:37:38] https://www.google.com/search?q=weechat+delay+join&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8
2018-08-22 11:21:47	bin_bash	[10:37:50] in the result it even has "Jump to How can I be identified before joining channels?"
2018-08-22 11:21:47	bin_bash	[10:38:05] so i must've just missed it, or there mightve been a weird issue on my end
2018-08-22 11:21:47	bin_bash	[10:38:38] (either way, my bad!) :D
2018-08-22 11:21:47	bin_bash	[10:38:54] poor FC is gonna come back to unnecessary highlights lolol
2018-08-22 11:21:47	bin_bash	[10:39:35] thanks both to sim642 and squigzy for the gh stuff <3
2018-08-22 11:21:47	bin_bash	[10:39:53] squigzy: i dont like this 2018. can we just return it for 2011

2018-08-22 21:08:56	bbugyi201	rydare: It says specifically passphrase. Isn't one branded a "passphrase" and the other a "password"?
2018-08-22 21:09:10	rydare	what is the passphrase for exactly?
2018-08-22 21:09:19	rydare	your nick on the server?
2018-08-22 21:09:37	bbugyi201	It happens when I first run the 'weechat' command. It also gives me the option to just press enter to proceed but warns that my data will not be secure.
2018-08-22 21:10:00	bbugyi201	This is the one for "secured data" I believe.

2018-08-22 21:18:47	bbugyi201	squigzy: Yeah, I probably wouldn't do that for something I actually cared about. But I don't even use the /secure command ever so I don't even think the passphrase gets used. I just want it to shut up about it. Plus I used a special password that I have set aside for stuff I don't care about so if someone hacks it all they'll get into is my reddit account, weechat data, online grocery store account, etc.

2018-08-23 05:56:17	rnmhdn	yeah sorry...
2018-08-23 05:56:21	Xelnor	you'd have to bind another key to that action
2018-08-23 05:56:34	squigzy	Or unbind in the termianl

2018-08-23 05:57:40	squigzy	If you're asking how to do that in the context of whatever vim plugin you're using, no, and this isn't the place to ask for help for that
2018-08-23 05:58:23	rnmhdn	I mean I'm using the vimode script for weechat
2018-08-23 05:58:41	squigzy	Ahhh
2018-08-23 05:58:45	presiden	did anyone have problems when compiling weechat from source and using the custom installation directory?
2018-08-23 05:58:46	squigzy	In that case, this is the appropriate place
2018-08-23 05:58:51	squigzy	I just don't know anything about that script :)

2018-08-23 06:00:55	presiden	maybe related to https://github.com/weechat/weechat/issues/354
2018-08-23 06:01:52	squigzy	Are you sure you've installed the dependencies
2018-08-23 06:01:53	presiden	but the solution there, -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=... still gives that error
2018-08-23 06:02:21	presiden	yeah, sudo apt-get build-dep weechat
2018-08-23 06:02:57	squigzy	Are you using an older version of cmake like some of the commenters in that issue?
2018-08-23 06:02:58	presiden	dunno why it didn't use that (found version "1.2.8") of zlib1g-dev
2018-08-23 06:03:22	rnmhdn	ii
2018-08-23 06:03:53	presiden	> cmake version 3.5.1
2018-08-23 06:04:18	squigzy	this might be helpful https://github.com/firehol/netdata/issues/24
2018-08-23 06:04:25	squigzy	Similar error, different software though

2018-08-23 07:58:03	quetzal2	rnmhdn: The problem is: it looks like the conditions are not evaluated or taken into account. The fact that the boolean change (on ⇌ off) is normal, since they are managed by the condition.
2018-08-23 07:58:07	quetzal2	ok.
2018-08-23 07:59:17	quetzal2	If you look at weechat's options, you always have a boolean describing the current state of the entity, and a condition or something like that managing it.
2018-08-23 07:59:44	quetzal2	What we should change is the condition. But even the proposed once do not seem to work.

2018-08-23 08:07:26	rnmhdn	quetzal2: It's very strange because almost all of the options for bar.buflist and bar.vi_cmd are exactly the same for me.
2018-08-23 08:07:44	rnmhdn	but then as soon as I press ESC vi_cmd disappears.
2018-08-23 08:07:58	rnmhdn	how can I see what exactly happens when I press ESC?
2018-08-23 08:08:18	sim642	If the script modifies the hidden option of the bar, you can't really stop that from happening
2018-08-23 08:08:59	quetzal2	yes, that's why I think that the condition the problem is.
2018-08-23 08:09:26	rnmhdn	that means the condition is not the problem! because the condition is the same for buflist and vi_cmd
2018-08-23 08:09:31	rnmhdn	I'm looking into the script now
2018-08-23 08:09:32	sim642	Yeah, it'd be more flexible if the script used a buffer localvar and a condition
2018-08-23 08:09:34	quetzal2	I've tried with the given examples, conditions in different formats, but nothing…

2018-08-23 08:10:54	quetzal2	rnmhdn: what do you mean with "the same"? you mean that buflist's condition is "" too? In this case, maybe the defaults are different, and anyways, it proves that something's odd.
2018-08-23 08:11:41	quetzal2	sim642: yes indeed :)

2018-08-23 08:32:28	sim642	It will output the code for the keys you pressed
2018-08-23 08:33:57	guther	 meta-meta2-B => /buffer +1
2018-08-23 08:34:04	guther	^^ this is the default binding
2018-08-23 08:34:17	guther	what would i press in this case?
2018-08-23 08:35:06	sim642	Just follow the documentation link
2018-08-23 08:35:11	sim642	It has user-readable key names
2018-08-23 08:35:32	sim642	The codes in weechat are often indecipherable and often duplicated for different terminals that behave differently
2018-08-23 08:37:55	guther	when i follow your link, it says - for /buffer +1: Alt(meta)+CURSOR-RIGHT / Alt+CURSOR-DOWN / CTRL+n / F6
2018-08-23 08:38:03	quetzal2	back! :)
2018-08-23 08:38:13	guther	but i can't make any sense of meta-meta2-B
2018-08-23 08:38:33	sim642	It's not supposed to make sense, it's internal terminal thing

2018-08-23 11:39:03	rydare	you can also add --with-lua and --with-ruby if you need it
2018-08-23 11:39:08	@nils_2	has nothing to do with the languages
2018-08-23 11:39:18	tomf	ages ago, yes. 2.2 was through an upgrade / update

2018-08-23 11:44:38	tomf	could this come back to something goofy with python?
2018-08-23 11:45:03	@nils_2	you set the expire option and downloaded the script file manually to the correct folder?

2018-08-24 00:44:42	willie3204	this theme and not being able to set the title on buffer 1 to static text are the last nagging things that would make me consider moving from IRSSI permanently
2018-08-24 00:44:53	willie3204	i can do the static text on title only with a recompile
2018-08-24 00:46:01	atluxity	have you put in a feature request?

2018-08-25 00:49:47	@nils_2	why is the filter for fset "irc.look.color_nicks_in_nicklist true" ? its not what i suggest
2018-08-25 00:49:50	hendry	alt+space does nothing here https://s.natalian.org/2018-08-25/1535179778_2548x1398.png

2018-08-25 00:50:55	hendry	i see, it's on now
2018-08-25 00:51:02	hendry	i am not sure how to dismiss this window
2018-08-25 00:51:36	@nils_2	like every buffer in weechat: /buffer close
2018-08-25 00:51:52	hendry	i am used to `/wc` from irssi, wonder if i can setup an alias
2018-08-25 00:52:00	@nils_2	/help alias
2018-08-25 00:52:17	hendry	will it remember by nick color prefs / alias etc?
2018-08-25 00:52:24	hendry	i do i need to run /save like irrsi
2018-08-25 00:52:58	@nils_2	by default weechat saves config on /quit.
2018-08-25 00:53:27	@nils_2	you can also a /trigger to save config periodically or simply use /save
2018-08-25 00:53:58	hendry	omg ~/.weechat is intense
2018-08-25 00:54:06	@nils_2	btw. a "window" is something different than a "buffer" in weechat. therefore a /window close will close a window
2018-08-25 00:54:20	@nils_2	and keep your hands off the config :-)
2018-08-25 00:54:37	hendry	how do i get rid of this fugly first column? https://s.natalian.org/2018-08-25/1535180060_2548x1398.png

2018-08-25 01:33:41	@nils_2	you have 256 colors enabled. weechat is using the colors dynamically.
2018-08-25 01:34:36	@nils_2	if you don't use more colors (for example for nicks) weechat don't allocate them
2018-08-25 01:35:13	hendry	perhaps i am looking more for a theme... it's not looking appealing to me (highly relative i know)
2018-08-25 01:35:47	@nils_2	weechat does not support themeing like irssi have
2018-08-25 01:36:49	hendry	my other stuff like vim is all using the solarized theme

2018-08-25 01:37:55	hendry	the FAQ says also /filter add irc_smart * irc_smart_filter * ... ok... not sure what that does

2018-08-25 01:52:04	@nils_2	weechat does not add/del values to options automatically, never
2018-08-25 01:52:20	@nils_2	you have to manually add your channels to the autojoin options or use a script

2018-08-25 06:39:35	phlux	I've never had to explicitly install screen-256color or tmux-256color
2018-08-25 06:39:37	MrElendig	which is a good thing
2018-08-25 06:39:45	phlux	Oh, interesting
2018-08-25 06:39:54	MrElendig	since then it will be available everywhere, handy if you eg are ssh'ing
2018-08-25 06:40:03	phlux	I suppose I've always installed ncurses/tmux as the first programs on my systems
2018-08-25 06:40:08	MrElendig	hmm void ships 6.1 which should have it
2018-08-25 06:40:14	phlux	Right, I agree
