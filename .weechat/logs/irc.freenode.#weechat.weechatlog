2018-08-29 14:28:00	phlux	Just the buffer number, no name, no counter

2018-08-29 14:28:48	phlux	Ah, it just shows "Act: 11" for example if there was activity on buffer 11

2018-08-29 14:45:14	rydare	it depends on your terminal, but usually it's something like Shift+Insert
2018-08-29 14:45:39	rydare	ctrl+v is your desktop clipboard, highlight -> middle click paste is your x clipboard

2018-08-30 01:17:36	FiXato	so, it sounds like you need to add twitch.tv/membership to the server capabilities

2018-08-30 01:18:16	FiXato	for which support probably first needs to be added to WeeChat?

2018-08-30 01:18:49	FiXato	but yeah, I agree with man_in_shack's sentiment... Twitch's 'implementation' of IRC is ewwww
2018-08-30 01:19:05	man_in_shack	almost as bad as discord
2018-08-30 01:19:31	FiXato	Discord doesn't pretend to be IRC at least
2018-08-30 01:19:45	FiXato	fwiw, I quite like Discord actually
2018-08-30 01:19:57	man_in_shack	yah but it pretty obviously is irc (:
2018-08-30 01:21:26	FiXato	it's more of a modern approach to IRC, without allowing everyone on a server to create their own channels
2018-08-30 01:21:51	man_in_shack	hah
2018-08-30 01:22:06	FiXato	it's more community-oriented rather than topic-oriented
2018-08-30 01:22:16	man_in_shack	standard ircds let you set them up with restricted channel creation
2018-08-30 01:22:37	man_in_shack	and standard irc channels can be communities (:
2018-08-30 01:22:53	FiXato	sure, but those are more the exceptions, rather than the standard
2018-08-30 01:23:15	man_in_shack	standard vs convention

2018-08-30 02:52:21	opan	I'd say that's IRC done right, although it's relatively slow so far.
2018-08-30 02:52:31	opan	free software, decentralized, federated, can bridge with irc
2018-08-30 02:52:55	crem	With all chat apps the main problem is to move relevant people there.
2018-08-30 02:53:10	MrElendig	(and be banned due to all the join/part spam of unstable bridges)
2018-08-30 02:53:17	mouses	crem: I generally (and i'm not the only one) keep those users banned.
2018-08-30 02:53:24	crem	For things like irc / discord, it's usually the decision to have in the beginning, and after that it's not really possible to move.
2018-08-30 02:53:25	 *	jokrebel cant see the need for matrix
2018-08-30 02:53:30	opan	yeah, but matrix is more future-proof than most chat apps, so think of it as the final move
2018-08-30 02:53:34	mouses	Endless flooding of join/parts and seems like a LOT of abusive trolls come from that network
2018-08-30 02:54:13	xt	opan: it's not future proof at all, maybe you can argue the protocol is, but the sotware is totally not, requires a lot of man hours to keep developing and maintaing
2018-08-30 02:54:19	opan	jokrebel (IRC): the federation is a big part. you can communicate with people on other servers
2018-08-30 02:54:23	opan	I'm actually talking from matrix right now

2018-08-30 02:54:48	opan	well, it's future proof in the sense that a company isn't in charge of it and at risk of shutting down, like you have with something like discord
2018-08-30 02:54:52	opan	and you can host your own server
2018-08-30 02:55:06	jokrebel	even dont got it. I also dont like multi messengers ;-)
2018-08-30 02:55:12	xt	that's more nuanced than that really, there's one company driving development
2018-08-30 02:55:52	opan	multi messengers? that's what I'd call something like pidgin. not really sure how it applies here
2018-08-30 02:55:57	opan	matrix is more like an irc successor
2018-08-30 02:56:11	opan	choose your own client, host your own server if you want

2018-08-30 13:58:49	ChaiTRex	Hello. When WeeChat starts up, it nicely puts each channel under its server in the channel list on the left (I have the main buffer separated from the server buffers). However, if I join a new channel, it appears at the bottom of all channels, even if it's under another server. Is there a way to force new channels to appear under their server.
2018-08-30 13:59:29	@FlashCode	ChaiTRex: yes, /set irc.look.new_channel_position near_server

2018-08-31 11:38:04	johnjay	the idea i had is highlighting the most recent lines a given person says
2018-08-31 11:38:07	FiXato	and test by typing yourself
2018-08-31 11:38:13	johnjay	like if it's two people talking, A, B, A, B, etc
2018-08-31 11:38:24	johnjay	it can be helpful to highlight only the lines of A. then only the lines of B. or something like that
2018-08-31 11:38:28	johnjay	a good point
2018-08-31 11:38:41	mouses	nils_2: That's a great idea!

2018-08-31 11:39:31	FiXato	just try with ctrl+R, followed by tab to switch to prefix matching, and type the first letters of their name, and then move upwards with the up cursor key

2018-08-31 13:03:49	GermainZ	similar to doing "/cursor" then <Up> a bunch of times then "q"
2018-08-31 13:04:29	sim642	Couldn't you just iterate the buffer lines data in infolist/hdata?

2018-08-31 13:05:21	 *	GermainZ looks into it
2018-08-31 13:05:55	sim642	I think every line has "displayed" or something

2018-08-31 13:15:44	GermainZ	ah well, I'll see
2018-08-31 13:16:35	sim642	You don't have the hook_focus hashtable unless you actually are in the cursor/mouse mode and click something
2018-08-31 13:17:04	--	satanist- is now known as satanist
2018-08-31 13:17:46	GermainZ	maybe I'm misunderstanding something
2018-08-31 13:18:29	GermainZ	but is a click necessary? considering pressing 'q' (or Q/m) works and the function uses the hashtable anyway
2018-08-31 13:19:05	sim642	What I mean is, hook_focus is for reacting to things while in cursor mode
2018-08-31 13:19:19	sim642	But you want to do something when certain vim-like command is entered
2018-08-31 13:20:26	GermainZ	right
2018-08-31 13:20:32	GermainZ	but I think I can do some hacky stuff
2018-08-31 13:20:58	GermainZ	that is, enter cursor mode, go to the line via `/cursor go` (I'm already doing these 2 things), then actually quote the message

2018-08-31 13:34:54	sim642	The y is for free content buffers, not formatted ones AFAIK
2018-08-31 13:35:00	qgTG	ah ok
2018-08-31 13:35:36	sim642	Another reason why it can't be the right thing is because you can open the same buffer in multiple windows and different scroll positions etc

2018-08-31 13:49:59	sim642	GermainZ, not sure if there's any exposed way to convert between line structures and actual screen positions
2018-08-31 13:50:23	sim642	GermainZ, internally those conversions exist in the curses gui code that implement the focus data stuff

2018-08-31 17:26:55	phlux	I've had odd behavior like that in the past, too
2018-08-31 17:27:03	phlux	Fixed it by deleting the filter and re-adding it
2018-08-31 17:27:24	phlux	I literally used the exact same syntax (just used my weechat's input memory to add the filter) and it worked as intended.
2018-08-31 17:27:39	phlux	I haven't been able to replicate it since, so I haven't submitted a bug for the issue

2018-08-31 23:41:42	@nils_2	orbea: i can not reproduce. i have exactly the same filter (maybe i suggest you the filter?). as mumixam said, you have two filter. a global one and a filter per buffer. lot of people don't understand the difference. i suggest using text_item to create a new filter item displaying the global and the filter per buffer
