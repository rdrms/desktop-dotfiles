2018-08-22 19:52:55	&Delicious_Cake	very anguished yu
2018-08-22 19:52:57	&vortmax	not good!
2018-08-22 19:53:44	@ForeverALance	>Yu Darvish is out for the season, so he finishes 1-3 with a 4.95 in an abbreviated eight-start campaign with the Cubs. Darvish was the highest-paid free agent starter this past offseason, but of the seven starting pitchers to sign for at least $16 million, only Jake Arrieta has an ERA below 4.50. The Cubs would probably like a do-over on that one.
2018-08-22 19:53:49	@ForeverALance	whoops!
2018-08-22 19:54:44	&Delicious_Cake	Hopefully Cole Hamels is spared from this year's Cubs curse

2018-08-25 20:21:29	&vortmax	the only reason the shitlib media loves McCain is because he was 100% reliable when they needed a "conservative" voice to shit on Republicans
2018-08-25 20:21:59	@ForeverALance	and he didn't even hesitate
2018-08-25 20:22:19	@ForeverALance	not only that but he killed the obamacare repeal that he ran on
2018-08-25 20:22:26	@ForeverALance	pure fuckign scum

2018-08-25 20:25:40	&vortmax	I mean that was literally the moment I jumped on the Trump Train
2018-08-25 20:25:52	&vortmax	when he refused to apologize for scuzzing the shit out of McCain
2018-08-25 20:26:16	@ForeverALance	too bad cunty meghan mccain will never forgive drumpf~
