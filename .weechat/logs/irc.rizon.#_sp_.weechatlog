2018-08-31 13:39:25	%QQSS	You go to your team and select up to three players

2018-08-31 13:39:49	%QQSS	You select two and you lose your first and second
2018-08-31 13:39:51	%QQSS	and so on
2018-08-31 13:40:18	%QQSS	So you have to decide if the a keeper will be worth more than who might be potentially available
2018-08-31 13:40:53	%QQSS	So in the 1st round you might have 2-3 people with a pick
