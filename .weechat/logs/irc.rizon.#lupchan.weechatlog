2018-08-31 00:11:45	tableflip	the library I used can't send unicode characters
2018-08-31 00:12:54	tableflip	but i could use alt codes I guess
2018-08-31 01:59:22	~nanasi	what kinda 90s library is that?
2018-08-31 01:59:58	~nanasi	can't it just pass UTF-8?
2018-08-31 02:00:28	~nanasi	or is it strictly 7 bit? In which case UTF-7
2018-08-31 02:12:16	tableflip	the standard Arduino library is strictly ascii
2018-08-31 02:12:30	tableflip	I'm using an improved version which can send some extra keys
2018-08-31 02:15:05	tableflip	i think it could be modified to do unicode, or I can send raw key data
2018-08-31 02:21:37	tableflip	this code is kinda fucky, it allocates a buffer then sends it without ever setting any values
2018-08-31 02:21:45	tableflip	for what purpose
2018-08-31 02:24:12	tableflip	Two tires fly. Two wail.
2018-08-31 02:24:12	tableflip	A bamboo grove, all chopped down

2018-08-31 02:24:32	tableflip	...is the best that Corporal Bobby Shaftoe can do on short notice - he's standing on the running board, gripping his Springfield with one hand and the rearview mirror with the other, so counting the syllables on his fingers is out of the question. Is "tires" one syllable or two? How about "wail?" The truck finally makes up its mind not to tip over, and thuds back onto four wheels. The wail - and the moment - are lost. Bobby can still hear the 
2018-08-31 02:24:32	tableflip	coolies singing, though, and now too there's the gunlike snicking of the truck's clutch linkage as Private Wiley downshifts. Could Wiley be losing his nerve? And, in the back, under the tarps, a ton and a half of file cabinets clanking, code books slaloming, fuel spanking the tanks of Station Alpha's electrical generator. The modern world's hell on haiku writers: "Electrical generator" is, what, eight syllables? You couldn't even fit that onto 
2018-08-31 02:24:33	tableflip	the second line!
2018-08-31 02:24:37	tableflip	"Are we allowed to run over people?" Private Wiley inquires, and then mashes the horn button before Bobby Shaftoe can answer. A Sikh policeman hurdles a night soil cart. Shaftoe's gut reaction is: Sure, what're they going to do, declare war on us? but as the highest-ranking man on this truck he's probably supposed to be using his head or something, so he doesn't blurt it out just yet. He takes stock of the situation:

The album was mostly received neutrally among critics, but was warmly accepted by underground fans. Despite the album's dark, grimy street sound, it peaked at number one on the R&B/Hip-Hop chart, and the single "Fast Life" charted on the Billboard Hot 100. The album features guest appearances from
