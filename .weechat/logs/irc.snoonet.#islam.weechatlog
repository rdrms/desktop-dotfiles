2021-12-27 21:46:29	ForexTrader	dense.
2021-12-27 21:46:32	ForexTrader	but just wow.
2021-12-27 21:46:41	ForexTrader	depth in the arabic scholars
2021-12-27 22:40:30	marmulak	I don't think ibn taymiyyah qualifies as a "philosopher", but of course Al Ghazali is rightfully famous for that
2021-12-27 22:42:28	ilm	dont need to be a philosopher to comment on philosophy
2021-12-27 22:45:01	marmulak	yeah that is true
2021-12-27 22:45:16	marmulak	if he was against philosophy that would make sense
2021-12-27 23:01:54	ForexTrader	well
2021-12-27 23:01:59	ForexTrader	speaker made good point
2021-12-27 23:02:18	ForexTrader	ibn tamiya was against logic/rationality thats wot the ppl think 
2021-12-27 23:02:22	ForexTrader	that he was rigid 
2021-12-27 23:02:26	ForexTrader	but in reality
2021-12-27 23:02:42	ForexTrader	if u look at his approach n how he responded to debaters
2021-12-27 23:02:53	ForexTrader	its obvious he utilized it
2021-12-27 23:02:57	ForexTrader	but about logic
2021-12-27 23:03:04	ForexTrader	very good example shykh made
2021-12-27 23:03:12	ForexTrader	ie:
2021-12-27 23:03:16	ForexTrader	isra wa mairaaj
2021-12-27 23:03:31	ForexTrader	when prophet said he was on journey (physically) to the heavens n came back
2021-12-27 23:03:47	ForexTrader	logic at the time told ppl.. that prophet was lying or he has gone insane..
2021-12-27 23:03:59	ForexTrader	cuz no jets existed
2021-12-27 23:04:03	ForexTrader	nore spaceships
2021-12-27 23:04:16	ForexTrader	so for them logic was this is impossible
2021-12-27 23:04:20	ForexTrader	BUT
2021-12-27 23:04:28	ForexTrader	when they came to Abu Bakr
2021-12-27 23:04:38	ForexTrader	n said..look at wot ur friend is saying NOW
2021-12-27 23:04:47	ForexTrader	in more of a mocking manner 
2021-12-27 23:04:56	ForexTrader	he said o yes? this is wot prophet said?
2021-12-27 23:05:02	ForexTrader	then yes, i believe him.
2021-12-27 23:05:07	ForexTrader	so he didnot use logic
2021-12-27 23:05:18	ForexTrader	he used faith in the prophet...there n then
2021-12-27 23:05:36	ForexTrader	so lot of times in life, logic may fail us to understand...
2021-12-27 23:05:55	ForexTrader	so ibn tamiyah thats why put faith in allah/prophet over logic
2021-12-27 23:19:49	marmulak	yeah I do think he is misunderstood
2021-12-27 23:21:16	marmulak	so I think what you're describing is more complex than logic or rationality (I don't know how you'd describe the difference between them in Arabic)
2021-12-27 23:21:57	marmulak	logic and rationality don't absolutely rule out traveling to the heavens, if Abu Bakr believed the prophet, it sounds rational on his part, for example the logic could be, "prophet never lies, so this must be true"
2021-12-28 00:07:30	ForexTrader	such wud fall into 'faith'
2021-12-28 00:07:42	ForexTrader	in end it all boils to faith (trust)
2021-12-28 00:12:44	marmulak	To some extent, but it doesn't mean you're being irrational

2021-12-28 09:53:13	marmulak	I think I watched less when I was a young adult

2021-12-28 09:58:58	@SerenaT	yes
2021-12-28 09:59:43	marmulak	there are lots of good movies in the world but also bad ones
2021-12-28 10:00:11	marmulak	we are planning to watch Don't Look Up and also Matrix 4 but I don't have very high hopes for the latter
2021-12-28 10:03:14	@SerenaT	nothing can quite match the wonder of the first one
2021-12-28 10:04:59	ForexTrader	ic
2021-12-28 10:05:08	ForexTrader	well i watch for usually lessons 
2021-12-28 10:05:17	ForexTrader	i like movies with sad endings

2021-12-28 10:06:18	ForexTrader	anything that gives life lessons is good i think
2021-12-28 10:06:28	ForexTrader	i hate just ONLY comedy.. no substance
2021-12-28 10:06:39	ForexTrader	i like take-aways.
2021-12-28 10:07:17	marmulak	SerenaT, yeah none of the matrix films were good imo. The first was just interesting for introducing an intriguing new concept and special effects
2021-12-28 10:07:18	ForexTrader	dont look up shows.. the politics n how american capitalism is 
2021-12-28 10:07:21	marmulak	kind of like the first star wars movies
2021-12-28 10:07:39	ForexTrader	never watched a single staar wars or star trek
2021-12-28 10:07:54	ForexTrader	episode/movie
2021-12-28 10:08:02	marmulak	you should
2021-12-28 10:08:07	ForexTrader	this sci-fi fantasy i dunno doesnt move me
2021-12-28 10:08:26	ForexTrader	wot is endgoal or msg?
2021-12-28 10:08:36	marmulak	the only Star Wars movies that really matter are the original trilogy, and you sort of had to be alive in the 80's to appreciate it
2021-12-28 10:08:52	@SerenaT	some good lessons can be had regardless of genre
2021-12-28 10:08:57	ForexTrader	sure
2021-12-28 10:09:03	ForexTrader	a good story 
2021-12-28 10:09:08	@SerenaT	i think youre right about star wars marmulak, we showed it to my college roommate and she didn't get it
2021-12-28 10:09:16	@SerenaT	and I understand
2021-12-28 10:09:24	marmulak	Star Trek is a different story, I don't know what to recommend to someone to try it. I guess the best Star Trek are the shows from the early 90's, like Next Generration and Deep Space 9. If you liked them then you can watch Voyager too I guess
2021-12-28 10:09:35	ForexTrader	if u begin with premise
2021-12-28 10:09:50	marmulak	SerenaT, I watched them all with my wife pretty much, but she thought the prequel trilogy was the best
2021-12-28 10:09:52	marmulak	for some reason
2021-12-28 10:09:54	ForexTrader	then may be ppl can get why X is fighting Y
2021-12-28 10:09:58	@SerenaT	hah
2021-12-28 10:10:01	ForexTrader	if u cant identify 2 fighting parties
2021-12-28 10:10:06	ForexTrader	then its just WWF
2021-12-28 10:10:12	ForexTrader	of robots
2021-12-28 10:10:28	@SerenaT	marmulak, the Machete order of watching Star Wars might be ineresting
2021-12-28 10:10:31	@SerenaT	if you're into that
2021-12-28 10:10:45	marmulak	the original Star Trek series is supposedly good, but I grew up with Next Generation, not the original. Supposedly Wrath of Khan is one of the best movies ever made but I only saw it as a kid and did NOT understand it AT ALL
2021-12-28 10:10:52	@SerenaT	ForexTrader, i think you're needlessly generalizing on scifi
2021-12-28 10:10:58	marmulak	what is Machete order
2021-12-28 10:11:32	@SerenaT	it is a sort of a diffent order of watching star wars movies - in some ways, it makes more sense because you go back and explain some things better

2021-12-28 10:12:20	@SerenaT	the Mr and I have been watching through TOS and honestly it makes some TNG episodes better
2021-12-28 10:12:23	marmulak	idk I just know the sequel trilogy is utter garbage
2021-12-28 10:12:35	@SerenaT	that's the thing, with this watching order you kinda get it
2021-12-28 10:12:36	marmulak	I guess start with TOS
2021-12-28 10:12:44	@SerenaT	it's still directed weirdly and acting is wooden
2021-12-28 10:12:58	@SerenaT	I don't know where to recommend people start with Star Trek
2021-12-28 10:13:02	@SerenaT	TOS is very dated
2021-12-28 10:13:08	@SerenaT	and TNG is getting there too
2021-12-28 10:13:10	marmulak	I thought so
2021-12-28 10:13:17	@SerenaT	but I still recommend TNG though, that seems the most relatable
2021-12-28 10:13:25	marmulak	good old tng
2021-12-28 10:13:25	@SerenaT	and I give some warnings too lol
2021-12-28 10:13:40	@SerenaT	like that one weirdly racist ep in the first season
2021-12-28 10:13:57	marmulak	hmm
2021-12-28 10:14:08	marmulak	we watched only a few eps from the first season
2021-12-28 10:14:11	marmulak	my wife didn't get into it
2021-12-28 10:14:22	marmulak	there was that one where the african dudes steal the white lady
2021-12-28 10:14:34	marmulak	ie kidnap
2021-12-28 10:14:36	@SerenaT	that's the one
2021-12-28 10:15:03	marmulak	I mean if I were an african tribesman I'd kidnap some ukrainian beauty too
2021-12-28 10:15:25	marmulak	jk
2021-12-28 10:15:28	@SerenaT	hah!
2021-12-28 10:15:37	marmulak	the weirdest thing I thought about those episodes
2021-12-28 10:16:27	marmulak	is that that girl (the short haired military person) is initially portrayed as gay and then the scriptwriters apparently force her to have sex with a male character randomly in order (I guess?) to prove she's not gay
2021-12-28 10:17:04	@SerenaT	I never thought of it that way
2021-12-28 10:17:42	marmulak	although maybe they thought this was in-character for her because Data is a robot, so maybe they viewed more like using an object to satisfy herself, who knows
2021-12-28 10:17:58	marmulak	still very weird
2021-12-28 10:18:15	<--	U_H (U_H@Snoonet-8gt.13s.r0hd0n.IP) has quit (Quit: Connection closed)
2021-12-28 10:18:21	marmulak	but back then being gay wasn't allowed
2021-12-28 10:18:26	marmulak	now it's mandatory lol
2021-12-28 10:19:25	@SerenaT	I always took her to be just practical
2021-12-28 10:19:31	@SerenaT	short hair makes sense for a security officer
2021-12-28 10:19:38	@SerenaT	Moving Out free on Epic
2021-12-28 10:20:25	@SerenaT	and the thing with Data was under the influence of whatever that was
2021-12-28 10:22:26	<--	marmulak (marmulak@user/marmulak) has quit (Ping timeout: 120 seconds)
2021-12-28 10:22:58	marmulak[m]	yeah that's true
2021-12-28 10:23:25	@SerenaT	i almost want people to skip season 1 and only watch starting season 2
2021-12-28 10:23:32	@SerenaT	the first seasons of shows are often kinda rough
2021-12-28 10:23:41	marmulak[m]	I mainly based the sexuality thing on how in one episode the characters have their minds read or something, they voice their inner feelings and thoughts, and she said something like, she's deeply conflicted and "confused" but there's no indication about what
2021-12-28 10:24:23	@SerenaT	subnanallah in Canada temps last night were -50C
2021-12-28 10:24:44	@SerenaT	that sort of signaling would def mean homosexuality now, I'm not sure it did in the 90s
2021-12-28 10:24:47	marmulak[m]	I thought maybe she represented some kind of lesbian stereotype like a masculine women who had a traumatic childhood
2021-12-28 10:24:55	marmulak[m]	yeah who knows
2021-12-28 10:25:02	marmulak[m]	-50C is crazy
2021-12-28 10:25:04	-->	marmulak (marmulak@user/marmulak) has joined #Islam
2021-12-28 10:25:28	marmulak	hmm moving out
2021-12-28 10:27:55	@SerenaT	it looks like a fun game
2021-12-28 10:28:43	marmulak	well I guess I'll greb it
2021-12-28 10:29:11	@SerenaT	i'm kiinda stuck on a level in M&M:CoH, and I've been cheating by watching youtube vids on how to do it
2021-12-28 10:29:20	marmulak	ohhh
2021-12-28 10:29:22	marmulak	is it the cake part
2021-12-28 10:29:27	marmulak	I seem to remember that being hard
2021-12-28 10:29:34	@SerenaT	turns out, I'm not doing anything wrong, just kinda need to persevere
2021-12-28 10:29:41	@SerenaT	no it's a bad guy named Ludmila
2021-12-28 10:29:58	marmulak	not bad girl?
2021-12-28 10:30:04	@SerenaT	ok bad girl hehe
2021-12-28 10:30:05	@SerenaT	bad gal
2021-12-28 10:30:07	marmulak	lol
2021-12-28 10:30:25	marmulak	I'll tell you something fun
2021-12-28 10:30:39	@SerenaT	hm?
2021-12-28 10:30:51	marmulak	I saw a restaurant in Iran that is a kind of famous sandwich place, which is like a version of fast food here, like not burgers but kebab on a bun and fries, whatever
2021-12-28 10:31:02	@SerenaT	tasty
2021-12-28 10:31:36	marmulak	they put this slogan on their sign that I couldn't get at first, it says "mā ghul-e āxarim" ما غول آخریم
2021-12-28 10:31:49	marmulak	"we are the last ghoul"
2021-12-28 10:31:59	@SerenaT	huh
2021-12-28 10:32:12	marmulak	based on context, I am almost certain this is supposed to mean, "we are the last boss"
2021-12-28 10:32:17	marmulak	if you take "ghoul" to mean "monster"
2021-12-28 10:32:33	@SerenaT	oh i seee
2021-12-28 10:32:35	marmulak	so I was like, damn that's clever
2021-12-28 10:32:35	marmulak	for an ad campaign
2021-12-28 10:32:44	@SerenaT	and you defeat this one by eating all the things on the menu?
2021-12-28 10:32:45	@SerenaT	:D
2021-12-28 10:32:47	marmulak	it's like saying, we have the biggest sandwiches
2021-12-28 10:32:54	marmulak	so they're the last boss lol
2021-12-28 10:33:00	marmulak	I bet their main demographic is younger men too
2021-12-28 10:33:28	marmulak	there's actually lots of clever ads here but that one surprised me
2021-12-28 10:33:29	@SerenaT	hah!
2021-12-28 10:33:32	marmulak	video game reference
2021-12-28 10:33:38	@SerenaT	I'm hungry now so I'm like "I'm in!"
2021-12-28 10:33:51	marmulak	oh man
2021-12-28 10:34:02	marmulak	for lunch today we had shawarma wraps and fries and hummus
2021-12-28 10:34:07	marmulak	I'm so full
2021-12-28 10:34:34	marmulak	what were all the free games on Epic recently? I only got like two of them because I'm lazzy
2021-12-28 10:34:49	marmulak	the main one I got that I wanted was Pathfinder
2021-12-28 10:34:50	@SerenaT	Nothing really stood out to me
2021-12-28 10:34:58	@SerenaT	yeah that was the big one
2021-12-28 10:34:58	-->	U_H (U_H@Snoonet-8gt.13s.r0hd0n.IP) has joined #Islam
2021-12-28 10:35:04	marmulak	I've been eyeing Pathfinder for years but never willing to pay for it
2021-12-28 10:35:22	@SerenaT	I love it when I have a game in my wishlist and then it's free :)
2021-12-28 10:35:30	marmulak	yeah that rarely happens for me
2021-12-28 10:35:39	@SerenaT	same here
2021-12-28 10:35:45	marmulak	steam doesn't really give away games, but if it ends up being like more than 50% off I tend to get it
2021-12-28 10:35:56	marmulak	but not 50%, needs to be like 60, 70, 80...
2021-12-28 10:36:04	@SerenaT	I have Humankind in my wishlist and there was talk that one was going to be free but then someone backed out of it
2021-12-28 10:36:18	@SerenaT	I decided I don't need to buy any more games until I finish a few at least
2021-12-28 10:36:24	@SerenaT	though I like that Octopath Traveller idea
2021-12-28 10:36:27	marmulak	there are some games on my wishlist like Octopath Traveler where it's like forbidden to ever go on sale for real
2021-12-28 10:36:48	@SerenaT	it's 50% off from time to time
2021-12-28 10:36:51	@SerenaT	down to $30ish
2021-12-28 10:37:02	marmulak	like the full price is $60 or something and that's like the "f you" price, and then it keeps going on sale for $30 which is like the real full price
2021-12-28 10:37:09	marmulak	it's like the game is years old it's not worth $30
2021-12-28 10:37:10	marmulak	sorry
2021-12-28 10:37:12	@SerenaT	I kinda wanted to get it on the switch but I think eventually I'll just buy it on steam for 70% of some day
2021-12-28 10:37:25	marmulak	right
2021-12-28 10:37:29	marmulak	maybe next year lol
2021-12-28 10:37:34	@SerenaT	I think they just try to get as much money otu of it as they can
2021-12-28 10:37:41	@SerenaT	this one seem to have a *lot* of content too
2021-12-28 10:37:42	marmulak	same with FF12 Zodiac age, I think Square is just greedy
2021-12-28 10:37:46	@SerenaT	storylines

2021-12-28 10:39:37	@g3t_re4l	question for you gamers
2021-12-28 10:39:47	@g3t_re4l	what's the best handheld right now? or coming out?
2021-12-28 10:40:00	marmulak	Analogue Pocket?
2021-12-28 10:40:13	marmulak	is the Switch a handheld?
2021-12-28 10:40:19	@g3t_re4l	yea like the switch
2021-12-28 10:40:23	marmulak	so
2021-12-28 10:40:33	marmulak	I don't think you can go wrong with any of the major ones
2021-12-28 10:40:40	@SerenaT	exactly
2021-12-28 10:40:47	marmulak	like the latest DS or PSP whichever they were, have a large library of amazing games
2021-12-28 10:40:56	marmulak	Nintendo Switch of course is the hot thing now
2021-12-28 10:41:01	@g3t_re4l	do they still make the PSP and DS?
2021-12-28 10:41:03	@SerenaT	if you're into retro, probably Analogue Pocket but honestly it's more a hobbyist device
2021-12-28 10:41:06	@g3t_re4l	Haven't seen them in a while
2021-12-28 10:41:08	marmulak	I saw loads of press coverage fro the upcoming Steam Deck
2021-12-28 10:41:15	@SerenaT	steam deck is delayed
2021-12-28 10:41:24	marmulak	Analogue Pocket is interesting if you have original gameboy cartridges
2021-12-28 10:41:31	@SerenaT	they don't make the DS and PSP anymore, if you want a current one, a Switch Lite is the handheld version
2021-12-28 10:41:39	marmulak	interesting
2021-12-28 10:41:57	marmulak	Steam Deck looks like it's going to be huge though
2021-12-28 10:42:28	@SerenaT	true
2021-12-28 10:42:32	@SerenaT	I worry they've overpromised
2021-12-28 10:42:47	@g3t_re4l	with the Steam Desk, is it mostly PC games?
2021-12-28 10:42:50	@SerenaT	mostly i want to know, can we put an emulator and FFTA on it? :D
2021-12-28 10:43:02	marmulak	you could cheap out and get some random retro handheld console that uses emultion and just download and play gameboy roms
2021-12-28 10:43:13	@SerenaT	g3t_re4l, I think mostly Steam games are supposed to run on it
2021-12-28 10:43:18	@g3t_re4l	free to download marmulak?
2021-12-28 10:43:35	@SerenaT	g3t_re4l, /r/SBCGaming :)
2021-12-28 10:43:35	@g3t_re4l	ahh ok, by the way, it's for the kids as a potential reward
2021-12-28 10:43:35	marmulak	yeah it's not exactly legal but getting thousands of gameboy roms is easy
2021-12-28 10:43:49	@SerenaT	abandonware is sort of shady legally
2021-12-28 10:44:07	@g3t_re4l	what's abandonware?
2021-12-28 10:44:10	marmulak	Nintendo will keep releasing the games on their latest console for too much money
2021-12-28 10:44:16	marmulak	although some titles may be abandoned
2021-12-28 10:44:26	@SerenaT	abandonware - games that aren't supported anymore
2021-12-28 10:44:35	@SerenaT	maybe the companies are gone, maybe just 'out of print' as it were
2021-12-28 10:44:54	@g3t_re4l	ahh I see
2021-12-28 10:44:58	marmulak	g3t_re4l, abandonware is supposedly stuff the company that owns it stopped caring about it a long time ago. They're still copyrighted but usually there's no way to get them anymore except downloading a copy online
2021-12-28 10:45:10	@g3t_re4l	interesting
2021-12-28 10:45:10	@SerenaT	a lot of gameboy titles have very confusing licensing that means they'll never be republished on any platform
2021-12-28 10:45:23	-->	ilm (uid197501@user/ilm) has joined #Islam
2021-12-28 10:45:26	marmulak	yeah that sounds about right
2021-12-28 10:45:32	ilm	salam
2021-12-28 10:45:35	marmulak	they're still making new gameboy games too
2021-12-28 10:45:41	@SerenaT	alaykumu salaam
2021-12-28 10:45:42	marmulak	it's turned into a hobbyist thing
2021-12-28 10:45:43	marmulak	ws
2021-12-28 10:45:49	@SerenaT	but not Nintendo
2021-12-28 10:46:14	@g3t_re4l	wsalam
2021-12-28 10:46:30	@SerenaT	g3t_re4l, there is also the Amazon gaming thingie, Luna
2021-12-28 10:46:37	@SerenaT	it's a subscription based thing
2021-12-28 10:46:49	@SerenaT	cool looking controller
2021-12-28 10:47:09	@SerenaT	given Amazon, you have some parent controls
2021-12-28 10:47:37	@g3t_re4l	right now they play games on the tablet and I have a playstation I bought a long time ago that they play on
2021-12-28 10:47:44	@SerenaT	Allah swt bless these men, picking up grabage on a cold day like this
2021-12-28 10:47:49	@g3t_re4l	but they tend to like handhelds becasue of the mobility
2021-12-28 10:48:14	@SerenaT	I know these guys get paid but still, it's a hard job and a service to the community
2021-12-28 10:48:56	marmulak	never heard of Lunna
2021-12-28 10:48:58	marmulak	never heard of Luna
2021-12-28 10:49:17	marmulak	g3t_re4l, which playstation?
2021-12-28 10:49:28	@g3t_re4l	3
2021-12-28 10:49:34	@SerenaT	I wouldn't have even known but when I bought a tablet during black friday, they pushed it on me
2021-12-28 10:49:51	marmulak	huh, luna works on phones, that's crazy
2021-12-28 10:51:20	@SerenaT	it's just a bluetooth controller
2021-12-28 10:51:27	marmulak	yeah
2021-12-28 10:51:29	@SerenaT	i mean i can hook up my switch controller to my phone
2021-12-28 10:51:33	@g3t_re4l	I told my kids that if they complete Hifz, I told them I'd buy them a PS5 or what ever is relevant at the time.
2021-12-28 10:51:43	@g3t_re4l	Or something they want
2021-12-28 10:51:44	marmulak	nice
2021-12-28 10:51:52	marmulak	"PS5 or better"
2021-12-28 10:51:53	marmulak	amazing
2021-12-28 10:52:12	@SerenaT	insh'a Allah is is a good motivation, Allah ease it on them to continue
2021-12-28 10:52:17	@SerenaT	how far along are they?
2021-12-28 10:52:20	@g3t_re4l	Insha'ALlah. Ameen
2021-12-28 10:52:57	@g3t_re4l	they haven't started yet. Most recommend completing 30th Juz before enrolling and they are in that process
2021-12-28 10:53:41	@SerenaT	that makes sense
2021-12-28 10:53:42	marmulak	make sure it's real memorization though, not like saying "z" for four different letters
2021-12-28 10:53:43	@g3t_re4l	also they haven't decided yet. I'm encouraging it, but it's their choice, I'm just trying to give them what ever incentive I can along with mentioning the huge rewards
2021-12-28 10:54:13	@g3t_re4l	very true marmulak, they are going through and perfecting their Tajweed right now
2021-12-28 10:54:18	marmulak	that's good
2021-12-28 10:54:41	marmulak	one time I met this lady who claimed to be hafiz of the qur'an in california, and I listened to her read some verses and she pronounced them so wrong I was like, sister you are not hafiz
2021-12-28 10:54:53	marmulak	I actually didn't say anything but I was annoyed by her in general
2021-12-28 10:55:02	marmulak	she also claimed to be a revert and she really was not
2021-12-28 10:55:07	@g3t_re4l	hmm
2021-12-28 10:55:35	marmulak	she was born in a muslim family she just told this story about how she "discovered" Islam in her thirties or something and now tells everyone she converted to Islam
2021-12-28 10:55:38	marmulak	so bizarre
2021-12-28 10:55:47	@g3t_re4l	interesting
2021-12-28 10:55:56	ilm	i think we should appreciate her effort marmulak 
2021-12-28 10:55:59	marmulak	yeah maybe just wanted to get out of making her prayers
2021-12-28 10:56:04	marmulak	I suppose so
2021-12-28 10:56:17	marmulak	if she's happy then I'm happy
2021-12-28 11:00:45	marmulak	I feel like kebab
2021-12-28 11:00:47	marmulak	for some reason
2021-12-28 11:00:58	rdr	i feel like a human
2021-12-28 11:01:03	ilm	do you have chapli kabab th ere
2021-12-28 11:18:00	marmulak	eh not really
2021-12-28 11:18:05	marmulak	I've had it before in Cali
2021-12-28 11:18:25	marmulak	here they do have ground beef ones but they're always long
2021-12-28 11:18:36	marmulak	idk what you call that, qima maybe

2021-12-30 13:30:47	Thuryn	[20:06:27] it's just kind of a soothing way to waste a little time

2021-12-30 13:30:47	Saudi	[20:07:16] Haven’t played games for a while
2021-12-30 13:30:47	Thuryn	[20:07:31] the soundtrack is fun
2021-12-30 13:30:47	Thuryn	[20:07:46] i listen to it sometimes when i'm doing other stuff
2021-12-30 13:30:47	Thuryn	[20:08:22] the one i pasted above "Katamari on the Rocks" is good for getting you a little amped up to get things done.
2021-12-30 13:30:47	Thuryn	[20:09:17] lots of brass, really fast drum line, lots of harmony, and nothing embarrassing in the lyrics
2021-12-30 13:30:47	Thuryn	[20:09:33] kind of the opposite, really.  they tell you to "do your best!"

2021-12-30 13:30:47	Thuryn	[20:16:32] Saudi, because if i let them play, the person who posted the thing gets money
