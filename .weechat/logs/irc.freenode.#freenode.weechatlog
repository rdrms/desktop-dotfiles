2021-12-06 16:46:45	echelon	they don't even get notifications if they're pm'ed
2021-12-06 16:46:47	luke-jr	shungite: it's a Bitcoin-based Domain Name System
2021-12-06 16:46:48	youmadbro	shungite I think is empty
2021-12-06 16:46:50	echelon	they're basically like drones
2021-12-06 16:47:07	shungite	i see 
2021-12-06 16:47:08	youmadbro	luke-jr that's not true
2021-12-06 16:47:24	youmadbro	it is not based on Bitcoin
2021-12-06 16:47:29	luke-jr	of course it is
2021-12-06 16:47:32	youmadbro	it is the first fork of Bitcoin
2021-12-06 16:47:35	echelon	it's blockchain-based
2021-12-06 16:47:40	echelon	happy?
2021-12-06 16:47:52	youmadbro	block chain is not Bitcoin
2021-12-06 16:48:00	echelon	it doesn't share the same blockchain as bitcoin
2021-12-06 16:48:00	youmadbro	is just a public ledger
2021-12-06 16:48:34	youmadbro	saying that Namecoin is "bitcoin based" is wrong
2021-12-06 16:48:34	echelon	you're making mountain out of an anthill
2021-12-06 16:48:38	shungite	blockchain is separate fro
2021-12-06 16:48:48	youmadbro	you can't do nothing with Bitcoin
2021-12-06 16:49:06	echelon	you can have apps on bitcoin ledger
2021-12-06 16:49:10	shungite	 it is the comfirmation of bitcoin transaction
2021-12-06 16:49:13	echelon	so what you said isn't correct
2021-12-06 16:49:40	youmadbro	Namecoin is not Bitcoin!
2021-12-06 16:49:45	youmadbro	don't even think about it!
2021-12-06 16:49:50	youmadbro	forget that!
2021-12-06 16:50:02	echelon	> you can't do nothing with Bitcoin
2021-12-06 16:50:07	echelon	incorrect statement ^
2021-12-06 16:50:20	youmadbro	can you register domains with Bitcoin?
2021-12-06 16:50:23	youmadbro	no
2021-12-06 16:50:28	youmadbro	what you can do with it?
2021-12-06 16:50:40	youmadbro	nothing
2021-12-06 16:50:48	echelon	you can run apps on it
2021-12-06 16:51:00	echelon	like ethereum
2021-12-06 16:51:11	echelon	just low byte size
2021-12-06 16:51:15	shungite	blockchain is the confirmation of bitcoin transaction 
2021-12-06 16:51:21	youmadbro	The first NFT was on the Namecoin block chain not on the Bitcoin block chain
2021-12-06 16:51:36	youmadbro	in fact all .bit domains are NFTs
2021-12-06 16:52:16	youmadbro	shungite> blockchain is the confirmation of bitcoin transaction 
2021-12-06 16:52:18	youmadbro	NO
2021-12-06 16:52:30	shungite	no?
2021-12-06 16:52:33	youmadbro	no
2021-12-06 16:53:03	shungite	what is blockchain then
2021-12-06 16:53:10	youmadbro	it is the longest proof-of-work, you can in theory mine blocks without including any transaction
2021-12-06 16:53:25	youmadbro	so block chain is the longest valid proof-of-work
2021-12-06 16:53:42	MJ	Why are you into cryptocurrency when the chinese communist part disapproves of it?
2021-12-06 16:53:56	youmadbro	that is Western propaganda
2021-12-06 16:54:05	youmadbro	it is not banned

2021-12-06 16:55:22	youmadbro	A few days back Binance CEO said the same as me! It is NOT banned! 
2021-12-06 16:56:20	youmadbro	What is banned is using it as currency! You can't pay with Bitcoin, which is totally reasonable. It is not a legal tender!

2021-12-06 20:50:54	Tuna	[03:39:59] while I'm at it, why does this network allow people to park ina channel they have no intention of chatting in?\
2021-12-06 20:50:54	Tuna	[03:41:50] founding a channel, to me, implies intention. Yet it seems they just want to park themselves.

2021-12-08 15:20:02	web-86	[22:01:20] I hope I can. that wallet had 975 or somewhere between 900 and 100 BTC
2021-12-08 15:20:02	web-86	[22:01:39] 1000 BTC
2021-12-08 15:20:02	web-86	[22:02:00] it will change a lot if I find it
2021-12-08 15:20:02	web-76	[22:02:23] hi
2021-12-08 15:20:02	MJ91	[22:02:30] Are you booted onto that disk right now?
2021-12-08 15:20:02	web-76	[22:02:35] is this chat for Cassandra database?
2021-12-08 15:20:02	web-86	[22:03:50] yeah I am
2021-12-08 15:20:02	MJ91	[22:04:19] Yeah don't. Boot from a different disk, mount it read only and run recovery tools on it.
2021-12-08 15:20:02	MJ91	[22:04:45] Unless the wallet file is on a seperate partition that is mounted read only
2021-12-08 15:20:02	web-76	[22:04:59] May I place a query for an update in cassandra?
2021-12-08 15:20:02	Noisytoot	[22:05:25] <web-76> is this chat for Cassandra database?
2021-12-08 15:20:02	Noisytoot	[22:05:26] No.
2021-12-08 15:20:02	Noisytoot	[22:05:29] See the topic.
2021-12-08 15:20:02	web-76	[22:05:52] Ok many thanks
2021-12-08 15:20:02	web-86	[22:06:32] I am not really a person that know s a lot a bot IT but from what I Udunderstand I can restart then. the MacBook nd created 2 partitions and run disk drill again ? is that what you are suggesting ?
2021-12-08 15:20:02	MJ91	[22:07:02] If there is really that much btc at stake just turn the computer off and pay someone to do it.
2021-12-08 15:20:02	echelon	[22:07:51] web-86: are you booted from the same hard drive that you're trying to recover from?
2021-12-08 15:20:02	web-86	[22:08:06] lol that if I can find someone to do it
2021-12-08 15:20:02	jarthur	[22:10:37] I don't recommend creating ANY partitions on the disk you're trying to recover from. The more further changes you make, the less likely recovery is.
2021-12-08 15:20:02	echelon	[22:10:51] web-86: where do you live
2021-12-08 15:20:02	MJ91	[22:11:39] Yeah just turn the computer off, put the drive in an enclosure and connect it externally to another computer (mounted read only) and run recovery tools on it from there.
2021-12-08 15:20:02	MJ91	[22:12:07] If the disk is dying I'd recommend making an image once it's in that setup and run the tools on the mounted image.
2021-12-08 15:20:02	web-86	[22:12:08] USA Florida. Harddrive is in Lebanon. I am. trying to recover it through share. my screen app

2021-12-08 15:20:02	echelon	[22:13:30] the recovery app would need access to the block device

2021-12-08 15:20:02	echelon	[22:13:39] i don't think you can do that remotely
2021-12-08 15:20:02	MJ91	[22:13:43] Have someone mail you the computer
2021-12-08 15:20:02	MJ91	[22:14:10] I mean you could try recovering the external drive too if you have not done a lot with it
2021-12-08 15:20:02	web-86	[22:14:29] I will mail the computer soon.  disk drill is running ro to recover block

2021-12-09 02:17:17	web-69	Which cryptocurrencies are you optimistic about?
2021-12-09 02:17:31	kr5	hi guys, can anyone help me with making bash script work? i'm noob and cant find the info need on the net..

2021-12-09 02:18:34	kr5	its basic one, consist of two parts, both of them work as standalone, but dont know how to tie them in one script.. they are like 2-3 lines each
2021-12-09 02:19:04	web-9	so you have two functions?

2021-12-09 02:19:34	kr5	yes, one is looking for open port in range of 4 ports, and the other one connect to the port
2021-12-09 02:20:16	kr5	but when together, the first one (port scanning) need "done" at the end and then the second one doesnt get the $port value from the first one
2021-12-09 02:20:42	web-9	make the search value return the port  and run the search function in the connect function
2021-12-09 02:20:51	web-9	assign $port to the return value
2021-12-09 02:21:41	kr5	i dont know how to move from the first part to the second, the first want "done".. ther eis obviously a way but dont know how

2021-12-09 02:30:10	kr5	how should i make it global?

2021-12-09 11:09:36	OsKaR31415	also, trains can be used on binary operators
2021-12-09 11:09:45	OsKaR31415	something like (+=*)
2021-12-09 11:10:02	OsKaR31415	that would test if the sum of 2 values is equal to their product

2021-12-09 11:25:53	OsKaR31415	idk whats the real difference in england / USA, but anyway, it's not paying
2021-12-09 11:26:00	OsKaR31415	so not exactly like a college
2021-12-09 11:26:19	OsKaR31415	university ? you don't have these in usa / england ?
2021-12-09 11:26:24	OsKaR31415	i thought...
2021-12-09 11:26:26	Tuna	england - uni, usa - coolege
2021-12-09 11:26:44	OsKaR31415	ok
2021-12-09 11:26:59	OsKaR31415	the thing is that, in france it isn't paying
2021-12-09 11:27:10	OsKaR31415	if it's paying, it is called a school
2021-12-09 11:27:13	Tuna	we do have colleges called university of X though
2021-12-09 11:27:23	OsKaR31415	ok
2021-12-09 11:27:47	Tuna	and there are community colleges here that I could attend for free
2021-12-09 11:27:49	OsKaR31415	so in france, college is middle school
2021-12-09 11:27:54	OsKaR31415	university is college
2021-12-09 11:28:05	OsKaR31415	*université is college
2021-12-09 11:28:20	OsKaR31415	low school is école
2021-12-09 11:28:38	OsKaR31415	but grand école ("big school") is college
2021-12-09 11:28:49	OsKaR31415	since université isn't really college (not paying)

2021-12-09 11:30:38	OsKaR31415	that is the mean

2021-12-09 11:31:00	OsKaR31415	in my fav language
2021-12-09 11:31:13	OsKaR31415	+/ is the redution by + (so the sum)
2021-12-09 11:31:17	Tuna	I see this:   (+/÷≢)
2021-12-09 11:31:35	OsKaR31415	≢ is the length
2021-12-09 11:31:54	OsKaR31415	and ÷ is obviously the division
2021-12-09 11:32:12	OsKaR31415	I see this:   (+/÷≢) > do you gave unicode support ?

2021-12-09 11:33:36	OsKaR31415	anyway, you have the mean definition in 4 symbols + the parents, what is really short, and very cool
2021-12-09 11:33:53	Tuna	cool.
2021-12-09 11:33:58	OsKaR31415	at that point, it gets useless to have a variable "mean" since it also is 4 letters

2021-12-10 01:07:11	FrostyCoolSlug	web-92 it's gonna be dependent on what you want to implement, and how.. if backend communication isn't important, then HTML5 would be a good solution, if you need some level of backend communication then PHP might be the way to go
2021-12-10 01:07:38	FrostyCoolSlug	Java is an option, but it's gonna depend on scale

2021-12-10 03:26:37	web-43	I'm here to ask for help installing Rockbox on an Ipod Classic 120gb model MB565. I have tried using the utility (I got an HTTP error at the end of the process), and also using the instructions here https://files.freemyipod.org/~user890104/bootloader-ipodclassic.html but I am still not getting the Rockbox bootloader, only the usual Ipod screen.
2021-12-10 03:26:37	web-43	Help would be appreciated.

2021-12-30 13:30:47	web-40	[19:19:33] Hi allemaal, ik heb kubuntu geinstalleerd op mijn Toshiba Chromebook 2 (schrijfbeveiliging verwijderd). Maar helaas geen geluid. Van alles al geprobeerd, maar niets helpt. Ook met andere OS geen geluid (Xubuntu, Linux Lite enz.), alleen met GalliumOS had ik geluid. Alleen GalliumOS loopt bij het installeren steeds vast. Wie kan mij de goede
2021-12-30 13:30:47	web-40	[19:19:33] richting wijzen. NB. Kubuntu bevalt voor de rest prima!

2021-12-30 13:30:47	web-8	[19:19:57] people seeking problem channels aren't as annoying as: "can I ask a question about ...??"
2021-12-30 13:30:47	freezernode	[19:23:28] people aren't seeking channels, they seem to think they're in a particular channel, not #freenode
2021-12-30 13:30:47	freezernode	[19:24:09] they're seeking project channels and end up here thinking they've found it
2021-12-30 13:30:47	freezernode	[19:24:18] are there a bunch redirects to #freenode?
2021-12-30 13:30:47	kanumaji	[19:25:01] freezernode: heres an example from last week. theres thousands of these wiki sites that still dump folks into the webinterfaces https://openkore.com/wiki/Main_Page

2021-12-30 13:30:47	freezernode	[19:25:44] oh, so it's freenode's web client that broke
2021-12-30 13:30:47	freezernode	[19:25:51] and doesn't take the channel from the URL anymore
2021-12-30 13:30:47	kanumaji	[19:26:51] yep & then it dumps them in #freenode. theyre not even looking for irc. theyre looking for help with their products
2021-12-30 13:30:47	kanumaji	[19:27:18] its like the final afterglow from the great schism
2021-12-30 13:30:47	freezernode	[19:27:35] no, it's a broken webclient
2021-12-30 13:30:47	freezernode	[19:27:43] the URLs are fine
2021-12-30 13:30:47	kanumaji	[19:27:51] rofl that too. ive never used it
2021-12-30 13:30:47	freezernode	[19:28:25] I only tried it during mandatory SASL time, where it was complely lolbroken
2021-12-30 13:30:47	luke-jr	[19:28:54] freezernode: the web IRC client changed, and isn't parsing the channel part anymore
2021-12-30 13:30:47	luke-jr	[19:29:08] freezernode: so people joining from web links to specific channels, end up in #freenode instead of those linked channels

2021-12-31 01:59:56	bandicootslice	I have an Acebeam T36 for about 2 years but I hadn't used it in a couple of months and now the battery (21700) won't charge while in my flashlight. I don't have a standalone charger or battery to test if the flashlight is malfunctioning or if the battery is malfunctioning. I don't know much about these topics, but my guess is the battery is dead,
2021-12-31 01:59:56	bandicootslice	so I figured I'd buy a charger like the XTAR FC2 to try to "revive" the battery. Do standalone charger like the XTAR FC2 "revive" dead batteries? Any other advice?
